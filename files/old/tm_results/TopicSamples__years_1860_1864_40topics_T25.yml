  text: "Winter quarters.;;; --There seems to be an impression with some persons that\
    \ the troops on both sides are going into winter quarters, and that military operations\
    \ will be suspended till the spring.;;; The Northern Generals have not the most\
    \ remote idea of any such inaction.;;; The policy of the North is to make the\
    \ war \"short and sharp,\" and, with this object, it has carried on its military\
    \ operations during a season far more trying to the health and endurance of Northern\
    \ troops than the winter.;;; If they had gone into summer quarters, and waited\
    \ for the fall or winter before attempting to invade a Southern country, they\
    \ would have shown more wisdom than in choosing hot weather for such an enterprise,\
    \ and adding to that folly by suspending operations during the most salubrious\
    \ and invigorating season in our climate.;;; So far from going into winter quarters,\
    \ the North looks to the winter \u2014 which, in the South, is mild, agreeable,\
    \ and healthful \u2014 as the period of its greatest activity and effort.;;; We\
    \ may set this down as one of those fixed facts which we may base our own calculations\
    \ upon with the most perfect confidence and safety.;;; To wait till the spring\
    \ is simply to wait till the worst season for Northern military movements has\
    \ returned again, to perpetuate the commercial misery and individual distress\
    \ in the Northern cities, and to increase the probabilities of foreign interference\
    \ for the purpose of procuring the cotton supply.;;; Mcclellan. looks forward\
    \ to no winter quarters except in the heart of the South, and will be compelled\
    \ to make the attempt, if not in the direction of Manassa, by some other route\
    \ which will strike at the capital and cotton of the Southern Confederacy.--That\
    \ he will meet with an annihilating defeat; that he will be even more thoroughly\
    \ routed than at Manassa, and not only routed, but followed up and annihilated,\
    \ is our firm conviction.;;; Nevertheless, he will make the attempt and such a\
    \ thing as \"winter quarters\" cannot be found in his vocabulary.;;; \"Winter\
    \ quarters,\" in fact, is an obsolete idea among the military men of modern times.;;;\
    \ Even in the old wars of American, our glorious ancestry was not tied up to \"\
    winter quarters.\" The snow-clad regions of Canada were invaded in midwinter,\
    \ and it was over frozen rivers that Washington led his soldiers with bare and\
    \ bleeding feet to their glorious victories in New Jersey.;;; We have a better\
    \ and a more inspiring cause than ever Washington defended.;;; We must take no\
    \ note of winter, except to provide our troops shelter and clothing, and derive\
    \ new energy from its healthful airs and bracing winds.;;; So far as going into\
    \ \"winter quarters\" implies inaction during the winter, we apprehend that no\
    \ Southern General dreams of any such suicidal imbecility."
