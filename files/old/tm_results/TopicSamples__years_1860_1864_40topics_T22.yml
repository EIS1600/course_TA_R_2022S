    for the present.;;; The resolutions adopted declare that "the policy and interests
    of Maryland require that no action shall be taken by which the State shall be
    committed until the State of Virginia shall have determined the question of a
    proposed Conference or some other measure requiring the co- operation of this
    State." The Convention further resolved that the proposition for a Conference
    among the Southern Border States, by delegates deriving authority from the people,
    would meet the approval of Maryland, and appointed a Committee to visit the Virginia
    Convention and express to them the "foregoing assurance.";;; "Those of the delegates
    who desired to go farther than was proposed by the report of the Committee on
    Resolutions, submitted amendments declaring that all attempts upon the part of
    the Government to "re-occupy," repossess, or re-take" any forts or any other property
    within the limits of the seceded States, would be acts of war, and that such acts
    would absolve Maryland and the Border States from all connection with the United
    States. Judge Chambers left the Chair and opposed these amendments as in reality
    opening the way to secession, and as initiating a programme that would not be
    sanctioned by the people of Maryland.;;; Strong speeches were made in support
    of the amendments, and for a time an "irrepressible conflict" threatened the harmony
    of the Conference.--Finally the subject was got rid of by postponing its consideration
    until the next meeting of the Conference.";;; The Commissioners appointed to Virginia,
    are Ex-Gov. E. L. Lowe, Judge Chambers, W. H. Norris, and Dr. J. Hanson Thomas.--They
    will arrive in Richmond to-morrow morning.

  text: The Conscript law in Georgia --majority and minority reports in the Legislature.;;;
    The joint committee of the Georgia Legislature on Confederate relations have made
    two reports to that body.;;; The majority report declares that Congress has no
    right to compel the citizens of the States to bear arms, except by a requisition
    on the several States for their quotas, allowing each State to exercise such compulsion
    as may be necessary, and to appoint the officers for her own troops.--They report
    the following resolutions.;;; Resolved, That all laws passed by the Confederate
    Congress to raise armies from the arms-bearing people of the States by compulsion,
    and without requisitions upon, or concurrent action of the States, are unconstitutional,
    and within our power to be declared void.;;; While Georgia makes this declaration,
    she also declares her willingness and determination to furnish to the end of this
    unjust and wicked war which our enemy is waging upon us, as she has done from
    the beginning of it all just quotas of troops that may be required of her, in
    a constitutional way.;;; Resolved, That under the Constitution of the Confederate
    States, and the laws of this State, all the troops which Georgia has sent to the
    field under requisitions from the Confederate Government have the right to elect
    the officers who are to command them, and that the laws of Congress which deny
    or impair this right are unconstitutional, and in our power to be declared void.;;;
    Resolved, That while the foregoing resolutions express our fixed convictions,
    we are still willing to leave the Conscript acts undisturbed in their operation,
    reserving to the State and her people such rightful remedies as may be demanded
    by future emergencies.;;; The minority report that the safety of the States demands
    that no opposition be made to any measures adopted by the Confederate Congress
    in the exercise of powers granted, and intended for our common defence; and they
    recommend to the "people of Georgia to acquiesce in the decision of the Supreme
    Judicial tribunal of their State; and His Excellency the Governor to countermand
    any and all orders which he may have issued to suspend the execution of the acts
    aforesaid in this State upon the citizens subject thereto."
