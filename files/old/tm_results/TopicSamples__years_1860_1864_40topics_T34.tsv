Although the distance was but a mile, no damage was done, as the shells did not explode.;;; It appears that they were of a new pattern, and very imperfectly loaded.;;; Private Scott, sentenced to be shot for sleeping on his post, has been pardoned at the earnest request of the President, the officers of his regiment, comrades, and others.;;; An order was read at the head of every regiment, informing the troops that a like clemency will not again be extended for such an offence.;;; A letter from one of the United States Navy commanders at Hatteras Inlet to the Secretary of the Navy gives some very important intelligence.;;; It appears that ten regiments have been withdrawn from Virginia for the defence of the State of North Carolina.;;; The wealthier portion of the inhabitants have fled from the seaboard to the interior, and the poorer classes are only waiting for the protection of the Union forces to declare their full devotion and allegiance to the Government of the United States.;;; It is well understood at Fortress Monroe that Beauregard must capture Washington, and that quickly, or suffer a disruption of his army by the withdrawal of troops to protect the various rebel States from invasion.;;; General Butler has been ordered by the War Department to report at Washington at once, and left Boston yesterday morning for that purpose.;;; This implies an important movement in his department.;;; From Gen. Banks 's column the intelligence is interesting.;;; The rebels made several demonstrations, as if intending to cross at the ferries, but in all cases they have met with a decided repulse.;;; The United States revenue cutter Harriet Lane arrived at Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon, to undergo repairs.;;; Fort Lafayette is still being patronized by persons acting illegally for the rebels and against the Government of the United States.;;; This noted watering-place will soon become the Old Point of New York, without the comfort of the one in Virginia.;;; The news from Cairo is very important.;;; It is reported that the rebel forces at Columbus, Ky., under General Bishop Polk, have increased to thirteen regiments of infantry, six field batteries, a siege battery, three battalions of cavalry, three steamers, and a gun-boat.;;; Jeff. Thompson 's rebels still remain at Belmont, Mo.;;; From the Washington Star of Tuesday evening we copy the following:;;; From over the river.;;; We have information from every point of our lines on the other side of the river, up to 12 M. to-day.;;; Nothing worthy of record had transpired there in the last twenty-four hours. All was quiet there.;;; The Artillery heard this forenoon.;;; The reports of artillery heard here this forenoon were of the guns saluting Governor Curtin and his suite as they drove upon the parade ground, where he presented the Pennsylvania reserve with a stand of colors.;;; A Baseless rumor.;;; This morning ""Secesh"" in Washington was a-glee with a rumor that the George Page had captured all the barges of the flotilla of the Potomac, filled with provisions.;;; Of course there is no truth whatever in the story.;;; The George Page does not dare show her nose outside of the mouth of the creek, up which she is kept, lest Captain Craven may nab her.;;; Removal of Ex-Minister Faulkner to Fort Lafayette.;;; Ex-Minister Faulkner, since his removal from the county jail, has been confined in the quarters of the provost guard, on Massachusetts avenue, south side, between Sixth and Seventh streets, in the range of buildings known as Phillips ' row. Three of those buildings are for the use of the two companies at that point in charge of Captain Williams, one is for the guard on duty, and one is for the officers' quarters.;;; In this last building Mr. Faulkner has been confined.;;; Yesterday morning at an early hour he was taken in charge by Lt. Worth, of the 8th infantry, and placed in a carriage, which conveyed him to the railroad depot, where he and his escort took the train which left this city at half-past 7 o'clock A. M. It is understood that he was to be taken directly through to Fort Lafayette, New York.;;; Arrival of prisoners.;;; Last Saturday evening the propeller Reliance came up from the flotilla, bringing with her three prisoners -- one a Confederate officer, Captain Maddox.;;; It appears that they had gone over to Maryland from Virginia, at Herring creek, near Piney Point, for the purpose of recruiting for the Secession army, and the officers of the Reliance going ashore there on Friday evening, were informed of the circumstance by an old lady living near the river.-- Captain Maddox was found in bed, from which he was ruthlessly extracted and transferred to the propeller, with his colleagues, who were together brought here and placed in confinement.;;; The Reliance reported all quiet down the river.;;; Confederate signals.;;; From Piney Point to Fort Washington there is a regularly established line of signals on the Maryland shore of the Potomac.;;; A steamer cannot move at night but she is telegraphed by signal lights at every three to five miles of the river, which signals are answered on the Virginia shore."	0.7511688470840454
