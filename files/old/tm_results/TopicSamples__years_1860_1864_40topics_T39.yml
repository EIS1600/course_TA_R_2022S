    Off Mulberry Island, on James River, Va. Dear--:;;; Since I wrote to you last,
    two accidents have happened on board of our vessel, one of which ended fatally.;;;
    On last Friday morning, 27th ult., we hove anchor and set sail up the river to
    get into fresh water so as to replenish our tanks.;;; After proceeding a few miles
    the sails were cast loose.;;; One of the men, named Pemberton, in assisting to
    unfurl the foresheet, fell overboard.--The cry, "man overboard," "stop the engines,"
    was instantly heard.;;; And he was in a truly perilous position, for the steamer
    was at full speed, and the paddle-wheel threatened to crash him, As soon as he
    fell in the water he commenced kicking from the ship so as to keep clear of the
    paddles, but yet he came just within a few feet of being caught by them.;;; The
    engines were immediately stopped and a boat sent out after him which brought him
    back.--It was truly a narrow escape, and he said that had they not picked him
    up then he would have been drowned, as the current was very strong.;;; At three
    o'clock P. M., we reached a small place called Apple Brandy, where we remained
    till Sunday, when our business being done we came back here.;;; On our way down
    here another accident happened, which resulted in the death of one of our firemen.;;;
    He went into the engine room to get a bag, when going past some of the machinery
    the crank of the port walking beam struck him on the head, killing him instantly.;;;
    His face was frightfully swollen. --He was buried yesterday morning, Sept. 30,
    He was a fine man. The accident was the result of his own carelessness. G. W.
