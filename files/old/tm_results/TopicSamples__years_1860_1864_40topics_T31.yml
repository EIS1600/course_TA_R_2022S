  text: Union demonstrations in New York. address to the country.;;; The "Young Men's
    Union Club," of New York, held a large meeting on Wednesday evening, at which
    Ex-Mayor Swan, of Baltimore, delivered an address.;;; He thought the danger to
    the South was not great now, but should it grow greater, a Southern Convention
    should be called.;;; The Breckinridge and Lane General Committee of New York held
    a meeting on Tuesday evening, to take into consideration an address to the country
    on the present crisis.;;; The delegations from the different wards were very full,
    there being but few absentees.;;; The first business being the address, Mr. Philip
    W. Engs, from the Executive Committee, stated that they had, with the assistance
    of Mr. Brady, in a very short time prepared an address, which might not be faultless,
    and which might meet with criticism, and he hoped it would.;;; He then read the
    address, from which we make the following extracts:;;; In the language of Breckinridge,
    "there can be no evasive middle ground in regard to this question of negroes,"
    and we National Democrats of the city of New York say to the men of the South
    and of the North, no State shall be coerced into remaining in this Union when,
    in the judgment of her people, her safety requires that she should secede in order
    to protect the lives and property of her citizens.--[Applause.] And on the other
    hand we proclaim our willingness and ability to meet the "irrepressible conflict"
    upon our own soil, [applause,] and assure our Southern brethren that if they will
    remain for a time within the Union, we will put down this fanatical raid upon
    the Constitution, the South, the Union of these States, and the whole white race.;;;
    It must be conceded that in the recent canvass many of the Republican presses
    have claimed for Mr. Lincoln that he did not concur with the frenzied felons who
    in their fierce onslaught upon slavery, blasphemously assail all ordinances of
    God and man which interfere with their dogmas or designs.;;; His declarations
    are cited to the effect that he recognizes the constitutional sanction of Slavery
    in the States, the validity of the Fugitive Slave law, and is opposed to negro
    suffrage.;;; His sincerity, and that of the more conservative of his party, is
    now to be tested.--There is some consolation in the canvass of our State, deplorable
    as its principal effect has proved.;;; The Republican party of the State, while
    it was enabled to give Lincoln some fifty thousand majority, did not sustain the
    proposition to amend our Constitution by permitting negroes to vote without a
    property qualification.;;; That measure is defeated by an overwhelming majority.;;;
    In our city it received about sixteen hundred votes, while the vote against it
    numbers about thirty-seven thousand.;;; It is our opinion that there are, in the
    Republicans ranks of the North, fewer Abolitionists than our friends of the South
    suppose, and an effort is to be made to prevent Mr. Lincoln 's Administration
    from interfering with or impairing the equality of the South in the Union.;;;
    Assurances of this kind are very general in this region.;;; In view of these facts,
    and considering now momentous must be the consequences of breaking up that Union
    f sovereign States which the blood and wisdom of our ancestors organized, we earnestly
    entreat our brethren at the South not to resolve upon any act which may dissever
    our Confederacy at this time.;;; Let us wait, at least until the 4th of March
    next, and then learn upon what principles Mr. Lincoln proposes that our Federal
    Government should be administered.;;; Let us see what class of men will be called
    to his Cabinet.;;; If, in the selection of doctrines or Ministers he evinces a
    tendency which may be regarded as calculated to impair the rights of any portion
    of our Confederacy, it will then be time enough to take deficit action.;;; If
    secession should now take place, and the Southern Senators resign, the whole power
    of the Government would be placed in Mr. Lincoln 's hands, and all Southern co-operation
    taken from the patriotic men of other sections who are prepared to support Southern
    rights to the last extremity.;;; This withdrawal would be particularly deplorable
    in view of the fact that Mr. Lincoln is to have a majority against him in the
    House as well as the Senate, if our friends remain where they are.;;; Brethren
    of the South, we call upon you not to desert us who have to the best of our capacity,
    and without hope or chance of preferment, profit or reward, other than the consciousness
    of having acted well, maintained the political doctrines which you advocate.--Do
    not leave is in a hopeless and enduring minority.;;; Do not infer from the vote
    in this State that the South as so few friends here as the canvass might seem
    to indicate.;;; Mr. Douglas drew off from their natural allegiance masses of men,
    who from personal preference, or the habits of organization, adhered to him, and
    we had no aid from any of the ordinary organizations by which the Democratic ticket
    is generally supported.;;; We had to rely upon the staunch and fearless support
    of men whom no mere party call could control, no persuasion allure, and no fear
    drive away from their sense of duty to the whole country, [applause,] the men
    who stand up and battle for the Constitution and the Union, and equality in the
    Union to all the States.* * * *;;; Candidates whom the South can support, and
    acceptable also to the National Democracy of the North, have as a capital whereon
    to urge forward in pursuit of honorable victory the votes cast for Breckinridge
    and Lane, and perhaps as the contest has become in all respects a national one,
    those also which Bell and Everett obtained.;;; Thus will be formed the great national
    party of our country, and around its banner all the true Democrats will rally,
    leaving the obsolete leaders of decayed factions in the ignominious obscurity
    and pitiful impotency which their meanness, folly, or corruption has secured for
    them.;;; Is the hope of opportunity for thus concentrating our forces to be destroyed
    by the South ?;;; That is the question to be dealt with by our friends there,
    and to be dealt with now. Its solution we leave to these friends, confiding in
    their honor, patriotism and chivalry.;;; We are ready and eager to contend for
    and maintain all their rights in any contingency.;;; but to give the struggle
    even one ray of hope must have their earnest and persistent co-operation.;;; Will
    they remain with us, or leave us?;;; We "pause for a reply," but we do not fear
    it. We think we can behold in the brighter days of our country soon to come, the
    splendid spectacle of a united and irresistible party, which, trampling down the
    bigot and the fanatic, whose false and odious heresies about the negro race have
    too long disturbed our repose, will place the Constitution, with all its sanctions
    and guarantees, in such position and keeping as that every American citizen, in
    all parts of our country, shall, under its wise execution, have protection for
    all his property and an equal enjoyment with his fellow of all the territory as
    of all the welfare which our nation may acquire.;;; [Applause.];;; In the name
    of our past history, in the name of humanity, regulated by liberty, civilization
    and progress, in the interests of commerce and property, by all the ties of fraternity
    and good will that ought to exist between the South and the National Democracy
    of the North, by all that is good in past, present, or future, we ask you to trust
    the fate of this battle to us. Ours is a common cause.;;; The attack is made here.;;;
    Trust the defence to us. We will resist the enemy successfully.;;; We have stood
    by you; stand by us, and, notwithstanding the imminent peril now threatening the
    common country, we will thus survive the shock, and preserve unimpaired this glorious
    Union of free and equal sovereign States, composed of free and equal white men.
    [Loud applause];;; In making this appeal at the present juncture, we are impelled
    not only by the considerations already presented, but by the evidence daily accumulating,
    that even uncertainty as to the course the South will pursue is seriously endangering
    our various interests, and rendering probable a commercial revulsion far more
    general and disastrous than that of 1857, from the effect of which we have scarcely
    yet revived.;;; Such a result would be productive not only of permanent injury
    to our city and all the interests depending upon it, but would entail on thousands
    of our laboring Democratic brethren during the coming winter, if not for a much
    longer period, want and suffering to a fearful extent.
