  text: News from the North.;;; Our files of Northern papers, which came through yesterday,
    are as late as Wednesday, the 11th inst.;;; We are thus enabled to lay before
    our readers an exlcuded summary of news from the enemy's country:;;; "the situation.";;;
    In its daily notice of the situation of affairs, the New York Herald, of Monday,
    says:;;; From Western Virginia the news is of an important character.;;; General
    Rosencrans is reported as having crossed the mountain in full force, and the pickets
    had even been fired upon by the rebels at a distance of four miles from the main
    camp.;;; This movement of General Rosencranz is one of great moment, and if the
    rebels will but stand fire, the intelligence of a battle of some consequence may
    be received very soon.;;; General Fremont 's proclamation caused at first some
    excitement among the members of the Cabinet, but has since been fully endorsed
    by them.;;; It is expected that the document may have some effect upon the actions
    of Garibaldi relative to the present contest.;;; Reports were prevalent in the
    Capital that the rebels had broken camp at Manassas and were advancing upon Washington,
    but the rumors were not credited by General McClellan.;;; All the works below
    Alexandria and above Washington were now considered capable of resisting any attack
    the rebels could make upon them.;;; Several attempts had been made by the rebels
    to cross the Potomac in the neighborhood of General Banks 's and General Stone
    's forces, but Irad in all cases been efficiently repulsed.;;; The intelligence
    from Fortress Monroe and Hatteras Inlet continues to confirm the reports of the
    returning loyal feeling of the residents of North Carolina.;;; Another fort is
    reported as being evacuated, doubtless preparatory to its surrender to the Government.;;;
    It is further reported that if the Union troops should invade Beaufort they would
    be supported by a large number of North Carolinian loyalists.;;; Commodore Stringham
    had arrived at Old Point in advance of his flag-ship.;;; [The assertions which
    are so freely made in the Northern papers about the "returning loyal feeling of
    the residents of North Carolina " are utterly false; yet they serve to stimulate
    the Yankee people, who are now shouting for a raid upon our neighboring State.;;;
    When this is attempted, they will be apt to learn the real sentiments of the people
    of North Carolina.];;; From Tuesday 's Herald we copy the following:;;; A few
    trifling skirmishes occurred between the pickets yesterday, and between eight
    and nine o'clock in the morning the rebels on Munson's Hill amused themselves
    by shelling the Union troops at Bailey's Cross Roads. Although the distance was
    but a mile, no damage was done, as the shells did not explode.;;; It appears that
    they were of a new pattern, and very imperfectly loaded.;;; Private Scott, sentenced
    to be shot for sleeping on his post, has been pardoned at the earnest request
    of the President, the officers of his regiment, comrades, and others.;;; An order
    was read at the head of every regiment, informing the troops that a like clemency
    will not again be extended for such an offence.;;; A letter from one of the United
    States Navy commanders at Hatteras Inlet to the Secretary of the Navy gives some
    very important intelligence.;;; It appears that ten regiments have been withdrawn
    from Virginia for the defence of the State of North Carolina.;;; The wealthier
    portion of the inhabitants have fled from the seaboard to the interior, and the
    poorer classes are only waiting for the protection of the Union forces to declare
    their full devotion and allegiance to the Government of the United States.;;;
    It is well understood at Fortress Monroe that Beauregard must capture Washington,
    and that quickly, or suffer a disruption of his army by the withdrawal of troops
    to protect the various rebel States from invasion.;;; General Butler has been
    ordered by the War Department to report at Washington at once, and left Boston
    yesterday morning for that purpose.;;; This implies an important movement in his
    department.;;; From Gen. Banks 's column the intelligence is interesting.;;; The
    rebels made several demonstrations, as if intending to cross at the ferries, but
    in all cases they have met with a decided repulse.;;; The United States revenue
    cutter Harriet Lane arrived at Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon, to undergo repairs.;;;
    Fort Lafayette is still being patronized by persons acting illegally for the rebels
    and against the Government of the United States.;;; This noted watering-place
    will soon become the Old Point of New York, without the comfort of the one in
    Virginia.;;; The news from Cairo is very important.;;; It is reported that the
    rebel forces at Columbus, Ky., under General Bishop Polk, have increased to thirteen
    regiments of infantry, six field batteries, a siege battery, three battalions
    of cavalry, three steamers, and a gun-boat.;;; Jeff. Thompson 's rebels still
    remain at Belmont, Mo.;;; From the Washington Star of Tuesday evening we copy
    the following:;;; From over the river.;;; We have information from every point
    of our lines on the other side of the river, up to 12 M. to-day.;;; Nothing worthy
    of record had transpired there in the last twenty-four hours. All was quiet there.;;;
    The Artillery heard this forenoon.;;; The reports of artillery heard here this
    forenoon were of the guns saluting Governor Curtin and his suite as they drove
    upon the parade ground, where he presented the Pennsylvania reserve with a stand
    of colors.;;; A Baseless rumor.;;; This morning "Secesh" in Washington was a-glee
    with a rumor that the George Page had captured all the barges of the flotilla
    of the Potomac, filled with provisions.;;; Of course there is no truth whatever
    in the story.;;; The George Page does not dare show her nose outside of the mouth
    of the creek, up which she is kept, lest Captain Craven may nab her.;;; Removal
    of Ex-Minister Faulkner to Fort Lafayette.;;; Ex-Minister Faulkner, since his
    removal from the county jail, has been confined in the quarters of the provost
    guard, on Massachusetts avenue, south side, between Sixth and Seventh streets,
    in the range of buildings known as Phillips ' row. Three of those buildings are
    for the use of the two companies at that point in charge of Captain Williams,
    one is for the guard on duty, and one is for the officers' quarters.;;; In this
    last building Mr. Faulkner has been confined.;;; Yesterday morning at an early
    hour he was taken in charge by Lt. Worth, of the 8th infantry, and placed in a
    carriage, which conveyed him to the railroad depot, where he and his escort took
    the train which left this city at half-past 7 o'clock A. M. It is understood that
    he was to be taken directly through to Fort Lafayette, New York.;;; Arrival of
    prisoners.;;; Last Saturday evening the propeller Reliance came up from the flotilla,
    bringing with her three prisoners -- one a Confederate officer, Captain Maddox.;;;
    It appears that they had gone over to Maryland from Virginia, at Herring creek,
    near Piney Point, for the purpose of recruiting for the Secession army, and the
    officers of the Reliance going ashore there on Friday evening, were informed of
    the circumstance by an old lady living near the river.-- Captain Maddox was found
    in bed, from which he was ruthlessly extracted and transferred to the propeller,
    with his colleagues, who were together brought here and placed in confinement.;;;
    The Reliance reported all quiet down the river.;;; Confederate signals.;;; From
    Piney Point to Fort Washington there is a regularly established line of signals
    on the Maryland shore of the Potomac.;;; A steamer cannot move at night but she
    is telegraphed by signal lights at every three to five miles of the river, which
    signals are answered on the Virginia shore.
