This is the meaning of their raids upon our Southern coast.;;; They are afraid to meet us on land; they mean to employ against us all the resources of their navy, and they must needs excuse their projected robberies, ravishments and petty thefts along our seaboard, upon the convenient plea of liberating our slaves.;;; The South may be slow to believe that they have determined to convert the war into an anti-slavery crusade; but foreign eyes are better detectives than ours of purposes of this sort, for it is to foreigners they unfold their plans, pleas, and excuses.;;; ""The latest letter of Lord John Russell declares that the issue is narrowing down to the question of slavery and abolitionism, and expresses the opinion that President Lincoln will soon declare all slaves within the United States free."";;; Fremont, the lieutenant of Lincoln in Missouri, has anticipated his chief in respect to that State, and the chief has publicly given out that he cordially concurs in the Missouri proclamation.;;; The telegraph announces that the greatest activity is discernible in the Washington Navy-Yard, and a war organ in Cincinnati boasts that ""the next we know, a mighty fleet, with ten thousand men aboard, will open one of our cotton ports; that the profound repose which the Southern coast and the nests of conspirators in the Cotton States have been permitted to enjoy, will soon be seriously disturbed."";;; Nothing is plainer than that a change of the theatre and plan of the war is absolutely necessary to a change of its fortunes in their behalf; and that the sole possibility which remains to them of preventing the active sympathy of European powers with our cause, is the conversion of their otherwise insane war into an anti-slavery crusade.;;; Their refusal of the challenge of our Generals before Arlington and Alexandria, and their assumption of a defensive attitude everywhere, from Maryland to Missouri, proves clearly enough that they have, at least for the present, abandoned the ""on to Richmond "" and ""on to Memphis "" programme.;;; Their plan of campaign is now to be a petty system of annoyance and theft along our seaboard, withheld and there a formidable demonstration against an exposed port or supposed depository of cotton.;;; In these raids they will ply themselves industriously to all sorts of theft, and will endeavor to sanctify and justify their contemptible larcenies in the eyes of the world by introducing Coffee into the case, and stealing negroes, along with pigs, chickens, grain, live stock, and household and kitchen furniture.--The righteous act of stealing a negro will be made to cover a multitude of sins and felonies contemplated in their new programme.;;; They are committing acts of tyranny now in their own States which shock modern civilization and throw the enormities of Bomba into the shade.;;; These outrages and whatever acts of absolutism and tyranny their tippling hero, McClellan, commissions on men and women in his drunken fits, must be excused to the piety of the world on the hypocritical but sufficient plea that the war they are engaged in is against slavery, and that the victims of these outrages are doubly deserving of their doom as traitors to the Union and as aiders and abettors of the damnable institution.;;; Their policy henceforth is to be a policy of cowardice and cruelty North and South.;;; They will send grand armaments to make attacks only when there will be the certainty of a feeble resistance, the doings of which will be heralded as brilliant feats of arms.;;; Regular operations in the field they will no longer dare to conduct: and they will endeavor to distract attention from their inactivity on land by naval expeditions magnified by their newspapers into quadruple proportions.;;; It will not be very long before they ingloriously stampede from Washington city, leaving to our army its spacious palaces of marble for winter quarters; and doubtless the grand armament for the sea, concerning which their newspapers are significantly boasting, is intended to create a diversion of the popular mind from that ignoble hegira.;;; It cannot be denied that the resort to the anti-slavery pretext is a necessary expedient to the Government at Washington.;;; What violence can they not practice upon refractory spirits at home in the name of abolitionism?;;; What ignominious defeats can they not successfully rally from under the fanatical banner of anti-slavery?;;; What acts of meanness, cowardice, butchery, rape, theft, and arson can they not inflict with Christian impunity upon the South under the cry of down with slaveholders and slavery?;;; Such is to be the programme and such are to be the shibboleths with which the South is to be assailed.;;; To be forewarned is to be fore armed.;;; We must prepare to resist their raids at all points; and we must anticipate and prevent them by carrying the war to their own doors."	0.8175281882286072

M. a messenger from our pickets reported the enemy advancing in full force, with cannon, wagons, and every thing necessary, and indicative of an immediate attack.;;; Two companies were promptly dispatched in double-quick time to sustain our pickets, and check their advance until our camp was put in a thorough state of defence.;;; In less than thirty minutes we were ready to receive our enemy with — not open, but loaded arms.;;; At 6 o'clock and 45 minutes our whole force of pickets — probably two hundred --holding an advantageous position in a short bend in the road, about one mile from camp, and under the immediate command of Col. E. Johnson, poured such a full and steady charge of musketry into their ranks as to confuse and scatter the whole column.;;; Lieut. J. G. Gibson deserves to be mentioned here, (officer of the picket,) as being cool and calculating equal to any emergency.;;; In this fight with our pickets, who were only driven back by a flank movement of the enemy, and in the thickest of which the intrepid Johnson was constantly seen, we lost, in killed and wounded, five men.--Our pickets being at last compelled to fall back from post to post, merely escaped behind our entrenchments, in a perfect shower of grape and canister.;;; All of our available pieces, five 6 -pounders, including one rifle piece, was immediately opened upon those of the enemy, eight in number, including one 12 -pound howitzer.;;; For six mortal, rather immortal, long hours these terrible engines of war replied to each other so furiously as to drown effectually the continuous rattling of musketry, Capt. James Deshler, temporarily in command of a detachment of Capt. P. B. Anderson 's ( Lee) battery, proved himself an excellent marksman.-- Capt. Shumaker, and the accomplished, brave Massey, rendered service, also, of the greatest importance.;;; The tried old veteran, Capt. Anderson, had two pieces, supported by Capt. Sam. Reid, in what our best engineers considered the most important position; but, owing to the fine disposition of our infantry, was not in action at all. The old Captain, also Capt. Sam., regretted their disposition extremely, and were only aggravated by bursting shells and whistling balls that they could not reply to. At 11½ o'clock three regiments were ordered to flank us in the woods, on the left.;;; A mortal foe, the Arkansas 3d, divided, under Col. Rust and Lieut. Colonel Barton, like so many spirits called up for the occasion, easily drove back the vandals in the face of fierce showers of grape, which, cutting through the branches of pine trees, fell far beyond, or lodged overhead without doing even the least injury.;;; Unsuccessful in executing a left flank, they fell back beyond musket range, but could not evade the range of our cannon, which dealt death in their confused ranks profusely.;;; Desperate, defeated in all but name, they made a last bold effort to flank us on the right.;;; The First Georgia leaped from their entrenchment, met, and gallantly repulsed them.;;; Their 12 -pound howitzer being crippled, which, added to their ill-success in flanking, the galling fire of our well-aimed pieces, and their natural cowardice, caused them to withdraw, carrying with them some 20 wagon-loads of dead and wounded.;;; They were, probably, 6,000 strong, and lost at least 300 killed and wounded. We were considerably the weaker party, and lost, killed and wounded-- I know to a certainty --not exceeding 18. Capt. Reld, of the 3d Ark. volunteers, lost one -- Wm. O. Blocker — killed, and one -- John G. Carter — missing.;;; They were pickets, and never did braver boys die more gallantly, Blocker continuing to load and shoot after being shot through the jaw, could not be prevailed on to withdraw to a safe place, was found today immediately in the road, whose body was at least a monitor to the murderous souls of our enemy of a fact they ought by this time to realize, that many such brave and noble youths will block their passage to our homes.;;; Peace be with you, my friend — a better, braver boy never met a more honored fate.;;; We fear the worst for our follow-soldier from Kentucky, J. G. Carter, We will, however, yet hope to see him return, believing an All wise providence favors the brave and just, and that our esteemed friend has not fallen, but will yet turn up, probably now lost in the mountains.;;; Special couriers from Huntersville state that the main den of the Yankees — Huttonsville --is certainly in the possession of our troops.;;; I believe no one in our camp doubts it, for heavy cannonading has been heard in it, for heavy cannonading has been heard in that direction all day. We are expecting an attack momentarily, and are fully prepared to welcome them again warmly.	0.8175281882286072

Ramsey, of the 1st Georgia regiment, discovering a large force of the enemy coming down the mountain, immediately fired into them, and held them in check for a long time, and then retreated in good order to camp.;;; The enemy, finding that our pickets (about 200 men) behaved so bravely, tired into them with cannon — a most cowardly act, and one unheard of in civilized warfare.;;; The enemy then advanced to an open field, ( 7,000 strong,) placed six cannon in position, and commenced a rapid fire into our encampment, and, after receiving five or six rounds, Captain Shumaker opened on them with his battery, Captain Rice joining in with his pieces, and for four hours and a quarter an incessant cannonading was kept up. In the meantime the infantry of the enemy tried to outflank us on the left and right; but, to their surprise, they found that the Arkansas regiment was ready to receive them, and therefore retired, the Arkansans cursing that they would not come close enough for them to get a shot; on the right, they were equally surprised at finding the 1st and 12th Georgia regiments ready to receive them, and did not venture near them, although the Georgians told them they would not fire on them until they could get in the open field, the enemy then being in the woods and covered by trees.;;; The enemy retreated in double-quick time after they found they could not out flank us, leaving a large number of wounded and dead on the field.;;; Our loss in this engagement was seven killed and missing, and twenty-one wounded. Their loss is estimated at between one and two hundred killed, and a large number wounded.;;; Great credit is due to Capts. Shumaker and Rice and their brave men, for the gallant manner in which they handed their beautiful little pieces.;;; We regret that Capt.

Taliferro 's horse, a very fine bay, was tied by our entrenchments, and the old fellow being asleep, a bombshell bursted right over him; he mere by raised his head, looked around, and then turned to his former position, as if in utter contempt of the parties from whence it came.;;; A little kitten, belonging to a company of the 23d, during the engagement, was seen running along the entrenchments, and whenever a ball struck near it and raised the dirt, the little thing would jump and gambol around it in playful glee.;;; The wounded.;;; I cannot give you the names of all the wounded, but all of them are doing well.-- Private Gus.

1860-11-07_article_0106	"Was the South ever Dependent on the North ?;;; -- The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. during the last year, delivered one of his characteristic tirades against the South, from which we make the following extract:;;; "" Is the South Dependent! --The little finger of a Northern man is worth more than the whole body of a master with whip in hand, and head on which he seems to use for little else than to hang his hat upon.;;; These threats of of the South to secede are like the meeting of paupers in an alms-house, and resolving to quit the institution if the country does not feed them better.;;; The South sucks the Northern bosom and we fill it with milk.;;; We work, and they reap the fruit of our toil.;;; We invented the means of their prosperity.;;; Whitney made the cotton gin that has done so much for the South, and he died a poor man, as they cheated him out of the reward of his toil.;;; Chivalry! Chivalry!"";;; The persistent folly of men like Beecher, who actually believed what he here asserts, that the South was dependent for its very existence on the North, and that she could be induced by no consideration of interest or self-respect to dissolve the bands that connected them, had a tendency to hasten the catastrophe, which was inevitable under any circumstances, more than anything else that occurred during the long war of recrimination that preceded it. In view of the actual facts, it seems strange to us how such infatuation could ever have fastened itself upon the minds of men who have been supposed, above all others, to act habitually from the promptings of interest.;;; While Beecher was thus in flaming his Yankee audience against the Southern people, and deluding them into the belief that separation was impossible, the train had already been laid, and the match lit. In a few weeks the Union was blown sky-high, and his miserable dupes have only learned, when it was too late, the utter hollowness of his cause.;;; The North has lost the trade of the South forever, and we shall now have a fair opportunity to see which of the sections can best dispense with the assistance of the other.;;; It is not even necessary to wait the slow progress of time: we already know what the North drew from the South, and what she was able to supply from her own resources.;;; The entire exports of the whole Union amounted in value annually to about $325,000,000. Of these the South exported in round numbers $250,000,000 in cotton, tobacco, rice, sugar, and naval stores.;;; Nearly the whole of this exportation went to Europe, and was paid for, not in gold and silver, but in silks, broad-cloths, wines, and other manufactures.;;; When these articles thus purchased arrived in port, they paid a duty of 25 per cent., amounting in round numbers, to $30,000,000. The South owning three - fourths of the importation, paid three fourths of the duty, or $60,000,000. In other words, since the Government was supported almost entirely by duties upon imports, she contributed three - fourths of the money required.;;; The North contributed but one - fourth --that is, $20,000,000. It can be seen at a glance by whom the Government was chiefly supported.;;; The North had a population of 20,000,000, the South a population of 10,000,000.;;; If the Government had depended for support on direct taxes equally and uniformly laid according to population, the North would have paid twice as much as the South; that is to say, she would have paid $54,000,000, while the South paid $26,000,000. The system adopted made the South pay $60,000,000, while it exacted from the North only $20,000,000.--Which party was dependent upon the other?;;; The Black Republicans say that the North paid the largest amount of duties, because it used the largest amount of imported goods.--The latter part of this proposition is true, the first false.;;; The North certainly consumed two thirds of the imported goods, but those goods were the property of the South when the duties were paid on them.;;; After the duties were paid, the South, not having a use for more than one - third of them, the New York or other Northern merchants took the other two - thirds.;;; From the sale thus made, the South paid broker's expenses, and received, in lieu of money or foreign goods thus sold, a portion of New England manufactures.;;; Out of the value sent abroad-- $250,000,000 --the South paid $60,000,000, or one - fourth of the whole in duties-- $50,000,000 more (that is 20 per cent.,) in commissions to brokers and importers in New York and Boston -- $20,000,000 to the Yankee manufacturer, in the shape of profit on his manufactures, sent to the South in place of the imported goods — and $10,000,000 to the Yankee shipper, who carried these goods, foreign and domestic, to Southern ports.;;; After all this, the Southern man generally spent his summers at the North, and there got rid of at least $60,000,000 more of what was left him after these successive exactions.;;; A writer who is not often mistaken in matters of this sort, says that the South annually paid to Northern manufacturers, merchants, importers, brokers, shippers, and hotel-keepers, sums amounting in the aggregate to $231,500,000.--It is easy to understand how their splendid cities, railroads, and canals were constructed.;;; Mr. Beecher is in a fair way to have the truth of his propositions thoroughly tested, as they have already been partially.;;; The South has separated herself from the North, notwithstanding his prediction to the contrary.;;; She will try whether she can exist independently of the North, and we shall see whether the North can live independent of her. The $231,000,000 which she had annually from the South will hereafter be spent in the South.;;; We shall see whether it will not, in time, build cities, construct railroads, and dig canals, as magnificent as any of which the North can boast.;;; We shall see, also, whether we cannot get our cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar to Europe without the assistance of the Yankees.;;; Let not the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher fear that we will hereafter be a burthen to Yankeedom.;;; If we have been dependent on her heretofore, we never will be hereafter."	0.7515522837638855
