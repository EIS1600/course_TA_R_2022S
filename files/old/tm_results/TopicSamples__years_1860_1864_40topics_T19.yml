    England and France are beginning to indicate unmistakably that their respective
    countries have not the most remote idea of dispensing with Southern cotton.;;;
    The London Herald of the 5th of February, anticipating the official news which
    we have just received from Washington, says:;;; "The United States so long as
    they cohered, felt strong enough to stand aloof from the public law of Europe;
    but the secession movement, besides opening up a door for the treaty of Paris
    being revised, and made, without exception, the law of nations, is likely to raise
    questions of international right, in which we shall have the deepest interest.;;;
    The United States Government was originally founded upon certain delegated powers
    by a community of sovereign States, who have still exercised their independent
    sovereignty, and it is held by the seconding States that the delegated powers
    may now be withdrawn.;;; If we must assent to this right we may claim admission
    to the Southern ports to carry merchandize on the American principle of free ships
    making free goods.;;; while, if we deny the right, we shall, no doubt, exclude
    ourselves from the Southern trade. ";;; Now, the treaty of Paris provides that
    a blockade, to be valid, must be maintained by a sufficient force, and it puts
    an end to privateering in Europe.;;; The London Herald says: "To recognize the
    treaty of Paris would be to make the Northern States of the American Union powerless
    on the ocean. "It is also said that Lord Lyons, the English Minister, has communicated
    to our Government the determination of England not to acknowledge a paper blockades,
    and the Lincoln Government has no means to enforce any other.;;; The same policy
    is promulgated on the part of the Emperor of the French, whose organ (Le Paye)
    esponses the quarrel of the South as "the victim of Northern pretensions," and
    denounces the North as "the aggressor," and as "exhibiting so much rashness and
    audacity" because it relies upon the abolition feeling of Europe.;;; But imperial
    France warns her against the delusion, and points to the present attitude of England
    as "beginning to measure the whole extent of the disaster which menaces her manufactures,
    and no longer disguising the fact, in spite of her abolition rendencies, that
    her commercial interests depend in a great measure on the prosperity of the South,
    while Europe has a deep interest in seeing preserved, at least temporarily, her
    institutions, now attacked with so much vehemence.";;; It is thus very evident
    that neither France nor England will permit a blockade of the Cotton States, and
    that it is highly probable they already have an understanding on the question,
    as they had in the case of the interruption of their trade in China.'

    be saved only by the principles contained in the Declaration of Independence,
    which gave Liberty not alone to the people of this country, but the world, for
    all future time.;;; If the country cannot be saved without giving up this principle,
    he would rather be assassinated than surrender it. In his view of the present
    aspect of affairs, there was no need of bloodshed or war. He was not in favor
    of such a course, and would say, in advance, that there would be no bloodshed,
    unless it was forced upon the Government as an act of self-defence.;;; Mr. Lincoln
    left, for Harrisburg, at 9 o'clock this morning.

  text: 'European Inconsistency.;;; The people of America, in that natural sympathy
    which they feel with the people of all countries, who are struggling to shake
    off alleged oppression, should not permit their enthusiasm to blind them to certain
    developments of the Italian contest, which afford a striking illustration of the
    real respect attached to principles of international law and national rights and
    independence by those who are most loudly prating of them, and who are eternally
    denouncing this country as a nest of filibusters and land pirates.;;; The fact
    that adventurous and roving spirits have gone occasionally from the United States
    to embark in such enterprises as those of Lopez and Walker, have been made the
    groundwork of the most sweeping abuse and denunciation of our whole country by
    the European press, and an English naval commander has played the part of policeman
    and handed Walker over to the executioner for his filibustering forays in Central
    America.;;; Whilst this abusive and bloody measure is meted out to our countrymen,
    Garibaldi is cheered on to the echo in his filibustering descent upon Italy, supplied
    by Sardinia, a Power at peace with Naples, with arms and soldiers, and backed
    up by English volunteers, who, no doubt, have done the hardest part of his fighting.;;;
    And all this has been enthusiastically applauded by the same public sentiment
    which denounces as pirates worthy of the gallows, and hands over to the executioner,
    such men as William Walker, who, what ever his faults, was a man of as much courage
    and talent, and engaged in quite as fair and practicable an enterprise as Garibaldi.
    But this is not all. Here is a significant item by the Canadian ''s advices: The
    Patriot says that ": Garibaldi has thanked the seamen of the English ship Renown,
    who served the Garibaldian guns on the 1st of October!;;; The men were that day
    on leave of absence. " Observe the fact that whilst one English man-of-war is
    delivering one filibuster 10 death in the West, another is landing her men to
    fight the battles of a filibuster in the East.;;; Whether Garibaldi be a filibuster
    or not, makes no difference in this outrage upon national right and justice.;;;
    England is at peace with Naples, and the landing of trained artillerists from
    a British ship-of-war, to work the batteries of an enemy of Naples, is a flagrant
    act of treachery and injustice, which it will be idle to evade by the pitiful
    and unworthy pretext already prepared for the occasion, that the men were on leave
    of absence and acting for themselves!;;; Every one knows that they never could
    have obtained that leave of absence, under the circumstances of the times and
    place, without a design that they should take part in the contest, and that they
    would never have dared to take that part except with the assurance that it was
    agreeable to the wishes of their officers.;;; What would be said of a United States
    ship-of-war in Mexico, or Central or South America, if her officers should permit
    her men to land and work the guns in the battles of a faction in those countries
    endeavoring to overthrow the government Certainly, we should never hear the last
    of it, and would probably be threatened with European intervention to make us
    respect the rights of others.;;; We have no sympathy with European despotism;
    we should rejoice to see all Italy capable of being free; we loathe and detest
    oppression in all its varying forms; but even if the King of Naples be as great
    a tyrant as he is represented, does England pretend that oppression and despotism
    in one country justifies the interference of another?;;; This would be a new principle
    of international law, and one which, if well founded, she should hasten to apply
    to Turkey, Russia, Austria and Prussia, her faithful friends and allies.;;; Nay,
    more; if she should presume, as she dare not, to set up any such nonsensical apology
    as a vindication at the bar of public opinion, how would she relish its application
    to herself in the case of Ireland.--Suppose that impoverished and oppressed people,
    who have suffered at the hands of England a thousand fold more than the people
    of Italy have suffered from any of their rulers, should again revolt, as they
    have often revolted what would she think of an Irish Garibaldi ? Let the gallows
    on which Robert Emmett and other patriots suffered answer!;;; And how would she
    regard the volunteering of Frenchmen, Italians and Americans under this Irish
    Garibaldi ''s banner; and what would she think of a French or American national
    vessel which should land its men, under pretence of a day''s leave of absence,
    to work the guns of the rebels and batter down her strongest fortifications?;;;
    Yet this is precisely her own course towards the friendly power of Naples.;;;
    Let our countrymen remember these facts, and avail themselves of them for future
    reference, when we receive our periodical lectures from the London press on the
    forays which a few adventurers and misguided men, whom there is no power in our
    government or people to restrain, sometimes make from our shores.;;; There is
    also another fact which we wish our countrymen to bear in mind, that they may
    know how to appreciate the justice of the abuse which Europeans so persistently
    and audaciously heap upon the United States, in connexion with an alleged disposition
    of our Government as well as people to intervene in the affairs of neighboring
    and friendly States.;;; The accusation is equally groundless and malignant; but
    what is the example they set us?;;; The intervention by Sardinia in Naples, Sicily,
    and the States of the Church, is one of the most flagrant acts of national wrong
    and injustice recorded in the annals of history.;;; The Constitutional justly
    says that between the invasion of Garibaldi and of Sardinia there is a great difference;
    the one, himself a Roman, comes to lead the disaffected of his countrymen in their
    struggle against an unpopular government; but Sardinian invasion constitutes a
    direct intervention of one regularly constituted State in the affairs of another
    independent State.;;; Strange to say, Sardinian invasion took place without any
    declaration of war, the representative of the King of Naples still being at Turin!;;;
    Count Cavour gave it to be understood that the invasion by the Sardinian troops
    was principally directed against the influence of Garibaldi; now it has become
    evident that they go to aid him.-- We repeat, let Americans bear these facts in
    mind, and they will understand that when Europe calumniates the United States
    on account of its alleged contempt of the principles of international right and
    justice, it is not because Europe respects these principles, but because she hates
    our country, and is as malignant as she is corrupt, hypocritical and false.'

    more than those of any other nation; but in a political point of view.;;; Spain
    is the country which a radical change in the social and political conditions of
    the American people, and the eventualities flowing out from such a change, concern
    the most.;;; The Anglo- Saxon race, settled upon the soil discovered by Columbus
    and conquered by Spaniards, increases in a threatened ratio, and holds Damocles
    sword not only over the West Indies, but also over all the American countries
    where the language of Cervantes is spoken.;;; "The troubles now threatening the
    existence of the American Union are not subjects of grief to the people of Spain.;;;
    Her political integrity, her interest of race, of religion, and her policy, require
    that a stop be put to the progress of this swelling population; if it were proper
    to be pleased with other people's misfortunes, Spain would, perhaps, have reason
    to rejoice at what is happening on the other side of the ocean.;;; Mean while
    the Spanish Government intends to watch closely the Spanish provinces of America,
    not that they are now exposed to any risk whatever, but because a Government must
    look to future events even when they are still far distant."

    that so far as Charleston is concerned it is a mere "paper blockade." --We copy
    what the Herald says on the subject:;;; "The British Government and the nation
    have displayed every desire to conciliate American feeling.;;; They sympathize
    deeply with the Great Republic in its trials.;;; But neither sympathy for its
    calamities, respect for its power, nor regard for its threats, must induce a British
    Minister to forego one iota of the rights of British subjects.;;; We desire the
    more earnestly to impress this upon the Foreign Secretary, as it is reported that
    the strict letter of the law will be rigorously insisted on by the French Government;
    that 'a mere blockade' will not be allowed to stand in the way of the shipping
    of cotton from New Orleans to Havre, and that, rather than imperil the interests
    of the French manufacturers, the French Government would be inclined to acknowledge
    the independence of the Southern Confederacy.;;; What truth there may be in this
    rumor, we know not. It would not be a new thing to find the French Government
    acting more energetically for the interests of French subjects than our own for
    those of the British manufacturer.;;; But it is obvious that it will not do for
    Manchester to be dependent upon Havre for its supply of cotton any more than for
    this country to be indebted to the foreigner for the recognition of her undoubted
    rights as a neutral power."
