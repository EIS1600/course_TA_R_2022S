    \ paragraph about the singular coincidence of fate between the Grecian and the\
    \ English poet.;;; But we were calling attention to the loss of all knowledge\
    \ with regard to the personal history of these two great men. One of them lived\
    \ several centuries before the invention of writing, so far as it is possible\
    \ to ascertain.;;; There were, of course, no written contemporary memorials of\
    \ him. His personal history was the subject of tradition alone, and became, in\
    \ the lapse of time, so intermingled with fables, that it is impossible to fix\
    \ upon any one circumstance related with regard to him, as an undoubted truth.;;;\
    \ The other lived, it is true, in a highly enlightened age. He did not, as somebody\
    \ has said, stand up grand and solitary, like Teneriffe, in the midst of the ocean.;;;\
    \ He rather resembled Mont Blanc, in the middle of the Alps.;;; He was surrounded\
    \ by great men, and he was a head and shoulders taller than them all. It cannot\
    \ but strike everybody as extremely singular, that we should know no more of him,\
    \ individually, than we do know.;;; In fact, so far as the undoubted knowledge\
    \ which we have of his acts and sayings may serve to give us an idea of his character,\
    \ he is as unknown to us as Homer himself.;;; The names of the two men are mere\
    \ symbols \u2014 symbols of the poetic gift in its highest state of perfection\
    \ \u2014 as entirely symbolical as the name of Apollo, or that of Esculapius.\
    \ We thought it singular that such should be the lot common to two of the three\
    \ men whom the world has agreed to call the greatest of poets, and we doubted\
    \ whether their individual obscurity might not be the penalty of their pre-eminence\

    \ traces of his personal history.;;; No man of his day was better known in his\
    \ day, and no man of his day is better known to posterity.;;; He was a warrior\
    \ and legislator, as well as poet.;;; He stood high in one of the parties whose\
    \ quarrels at that time shook Florence to its centre.;;; He was exiled for his\
    \ adherence to an unfortunate faction.;;; Of course his life was public, and could\
    \ not fail to be recorded, when his poem had given his name such a wonderful power\
    \ of attraction.;;; In a contemporary-- one of the first of Italian prose writers,\
    \ as he continues to be one of the best \u2014 in the inimitable Boccaio, he found\
    \ a biographer, whose pride it was to record the incidents of his life with minute\
    \ punctuality.;;; So far he differed from his great rivals.;;; Is his fate enviable\
    \ in that respect?;;; We should think not. If we were a great poet, we should\
    \ say, \"remember my works forever, read them, preserve them, hand them down to\
    \ the latest posterity; but for me, individually, lay me in the grave when I am\
    \ dead, throw the earth upon my coffin, and there let me lie until summoned to\
    \ judgment by the last trumpet.--Let not me, and my actions, and my sayings, be\
    \ the subject of prurient curiosity to the gossips of future ages.;;; Let no Boswell\
    \ come near me. Let me be known only by my works.\" Probably no two poets that\
    \ ever lived have said so little about themselves, as Homer and Shakspeare. This\
    \ has been considered a remarkable trait in each, and the modesty of both has\
    \ been greatly praised therefore.;;; We see nothing remarkable and nothing deserving\
    \ of praise in it. Homer wrote epics.;;; Shakspeare wrote dramas.--The first tells\
    \ the tale of heroes who had lived a century before him, under the direct inspiration\
    \ of the muse.;;; There was no means of dragging himself or his concerns into\
    \ the narrative.;;; The second brings on the stage persons long since dead.;;;\
    \ They speak only of things that happened long ago, in which they were actors.;;;\
    \ They could not speak of the poet, because they lived long before he was born,\
    \ and they do speak as though they were living in the world of their own day.;;;\
    \ Dante, on the contrary, tells his own story.;;; His poem is a record of what\
    \ he saw with his own eyes, and of the reflections which he makes thereupon.;;;\
    \ It is like a book of travels, in which the traveller notes each particular incident\
    \ as it occurs, and makes his comments as he goes.;;; In one respect, at least,\
    \ he surpasses all other writers.;;; His poem is the most original book that ever\
    \ was written.-- Homer, undoubtedly, made free use of the materials that had been\
    \ left by older Rhapsodists.;;; He tells us himself that the exploits of the Greeks\
    \ at the siege of Troy had been sung before his day. Shakspeare, not only re-wrote\
    \ many old plays, but he is indebted for all his plots (or nearly all) to something\
    \ that was in print before his time.;;; But where shall we look for the original\
    \ of Dante ? In the works of Virgil, for whom he professed a slavish admiration,\
    \ altogether unaccountable to us who know his vast superiority over that poet?;;;\

    \ the invisible world, bear no more resemblance to each other than Helen bears\
    \ to the blessed Virgin, or Ulysses to St.;;; Paul. The story of a vision which\
    \ some enthusiast had before the advent of Dante has been republished; but in\
    \ it we are unable to see any traces of the Divine Comedy.--The fact is, not only\

    \ mission to be a high one, as we may learn from Bocaccio, from whose words it\
    \ seems probable that he had conceived the design before he had yet become an\
    \ exile. \"Looking down,\" says Bocaccio, \"from his high place as a ruler of\
    \ his city and seeing the nature of man's life, the blind wanderings of the multitude,\
    \ and the sudden and unforeseen accidents to which it is exposed, there came thus\
