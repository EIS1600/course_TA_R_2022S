  abstract = {Karez system is considered as the global human heritage since it is not only a traditional water supply system of exploiting groundwater, but also it reflects the culture, socio-economy, and history of the ancient civilizations that had utilized them for thousands of years in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. However, with the explosive population growth and rapid development of pumping technology in the last century, the karezes dried up or were abandoned as pumping wells lower the groundwater table. This poses a dilemma to policy makers whether to facilitate large-scale utilization of pumping well technology over karez system and treat karez as a cultural heritage which is non-functional for food production, or to keep using and preserving the karez system as a sustainable way of groundwater management as part of the integrated water supply systems in the arid regions. In this paper, we reviewed the historical, socio-economic, and cultural importance of karezes in the arid regions. We also discussed the distribution of karezes in the world, their unique geographical characteristics, technological advantages and limitations. We observed that the karez system is not only economically robust over the long term, but also a viable water supply technique for irrigation and domestic uses. The karezes should be protected as indigenous human heritage, and at the same time, they can be utilized as a sustainable way of water resources management in the arid regions to enhance water resiliency under changing environment.},

French experts on the Orient imagined oppressed natives awaiting their liberation and imagined themselves as competent liberators and managers of resources. In reality, the French faced manipulative natives and a holy war, and they had to reinstall the very ancient régime they came to depose. The French brought environmental destruction to Upper Egypt with a massive wave of plague.},

Analogies between these theoretical perspectives and the two visual systems involved in visual perception (the dorsal and ventral stream) suggest that the literature on visual information processing can be organized around two types of processes: object processing and spatial processing. Object processing involves the identification and recognition of stimuli in the environment and is shaped by existing concepts and associations in memory. It is associated with the processing of properties of objects such as color, size, shape, and pictorial details that are considered in this review. Spatial processing involves the perception of location, movement, spatial relations, and transformation of objects and other stimuli. Imagery-based processes that are used to transform marketing stimuli in order to simulate various possibilities are reviewed in this section along with individual differences in spatial and visual abilities.},

  abstract = {[Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have long been engaged in a tripartite polemical and intellectual tradition. An early modern example of this interaction appears in a five-page manuscript collection of information about Islam compiled by the Venetian rabbi Leon Modena (1571—1648). He relied on the 1547 Italian edition of the Qur'an published by Andrea Arrivabene. It had its roots in Christian versions of the Qur'an and supplementary material about Islam. Christians used classical Islamic commentaries to prepare comprehensible and nuanced versions of the Qur'an, and around the text they also included hostile notes, introductions, and appendices. Modena processed the material following his Christian predecessors by culling excerpts, paraphrasing, and using some of his own Jewish vocabulary. He did not distinguish whether material was from the accompanying corpus or the Qur'an. Modena presents Islam in a positive light, very close to rabbinic Jewish practice, and he uses information about Islam, provided by Christian polemicists against Islam, against Christianity. As cultural mediators draw closer to other cultures, the ensuing distancing from their own culture leaves them with deeper insight about it or a greater critical vantage point. As a result, Arrivabene, Modena, and others in this textual tradition ran into trouble with their own religious authorities. Jews, Christians, and Muslims who draw close to each other today still face some of the same challenges.]},

  abstract = {One of the most controversial episodes in the life of the Prophet Muhammad concerns an incident in which he allegedly mistook words suggested by Satan as divine revelation. Known as the Satanic verses, these praises to the pagan deities contradict the Islamic belief that Allah is one and absolute. Muslims today--of all sects--deny that the incident of the Satanic verses took place. But as Shahab Ahmed explains, Muslims did not always hold this view. Before Orthodoxy wrestles with the question of how religions establish truth--especially religions such as Islam that lack a centralized authority to codify beliefs. Taking the now universally rejected incident of the Satanic verses as a case study in the formation of Islamic orthodoxy, Ahmed shows that early Muslims, circa 632 to 800 CE, held the exact opposite belief. For them, the Satanic verses were an established fact in the history of the Prophet. Ahmed offers a detailed account of the attitudes of Muslims to the Satanic verses in the first two centuries of Islam and traces the chains of transmission in the historical reports known as riwāyah. Touching directly on the nature of Muhammad's prophetic visions, the interpretation of the Satanic verses incident is a question of profound importance in Islam, one that plays a role in defining the limits of what Muslims may legitimately say and do--issues crucial to understanding the contemporary Islamic world.--},

The imamate of Tāhart even stood, in the posthumous memory of the school, as an ideal counter-model of the caliphate. In fact, during the 8th and 9th centuries western Ibāḍism remained under the influence of its eastern strongholds, in particular Baṣra where the sectarian elite was well integrated into ʿAbbāsid culture. Intense scholarly exchange linked west and east thanks to intermediary meeting points like Mecca and Fusṭāṭ. The Ibāḍī political opposition of ‘Berber’ and ‘Arab’ ethnicity certainly worked against the imperial discourse, but the Persian shuʿūbiyya shaped it. The Rustamid imamate came to be the symbol of a Persian state in a Berber milieu and its capital and state apparatus underwent a gradual orientalization. Trade also played a key role in connecting the Ibāḍī network with the empire. Baṣra was a notorious emporium and Ibāḍī merchants circulated widely between the ʿAbbāsid realm and its western fringes.

They claim that French orientalists in the early twentieth century created an ideal type of the Islamic city as contrasted with its Western counterpart in order to support the assumptions of orientalist discourse. The first part of the article challenges this assumption by showing that the French orientalists did not in fact posit an Islamic city type. The second part offers an alternative explanation for the genesis of the concept by tracing it to the work of American anthropologists in the 1950s.},

The theory provides the conceptual underpinnings for a new approach which moves away from expert defined standardised metadata to a user driven approach with users as metadata co-creators. Moving away from definitive, authoritative, metadata to a system that reflects the diversity of users' terminologies, it changes the current focus on metadata simplicity and efficiency to one of metadata enriching, which is a continuous and evolving process of data linking. From predefined description to information conceptualised, contextualised and filtered at the point of delivery. By presenting this shift, this book provides a coherent structure in which future technological developments can be considered. * Metadata is valuable when continuously enriched by experts and users* Metadata enriching results from ubiquitous linking * Metadata is a resource that should be linked openly* The power of metadata is unlocked when enriched metadata is filtered for users individually},

This book will be essential reading for advanced students and academics of Religious studies, Arabic and Islamic studies and those interested in the work of Derrida and Ibn 'Arabi.},

Oaths are multifaceted, rich expressions, in which a single oath contains a line of meaning and a variety of aspects. This study proposes a new stylometric model for detecting apparent and narrative oaths. Toward this end, two types of application-specific features from a stylometric perspective—structural and content-specific features—were examined. The stylometric features were extracted, and a Bayesian network was constructed to model such features. The stylometric model of oaths was then evaluated through a series of machine-learning experiments using various classifiers: the Bayesian network, a decision tree, instance-based learning, and a neural network. These classification experiments focused on applying stylometric features in apparent and narrative oaths. The experiments covered two datasets: the entire Quran and the smaller dataset of Juz ’ ‘ Amma . The results led to two main conclusions. First, stylometric application-specific features are best used in their entirety—both structural-based and content-specific—rather than as two separate entities. Second, applying stylometric features was more significant in Juz ’ ‘ Amma , in which 40\% of its surahs (chapters) contain oath statements. Finally, the stylometric model was extended for oath styles detection using three additional stylometric features—syntactic, character, and lexical, and it was analyzed using statistical approach.},

This article examines the reality of destitute Jews living in Egypt and Syria under the Ayyubid regime in order to determine which of the two conflicting Shāfiʿī rulings was applied in practice. Drawing on Geniza documents and literary sources, I argue that in the Ayyubid period no exemptions were offered to the poor whatsoever. This taxation policy, in my view, may reflect not an arbitrary choice made by local Ayyubid tax officials, but a conscious decision made by the Ayyubid rulers and the leading contemporary Shāfiʿī scholars. The Ayyubids most likely appealed to the Shāfiʿī religious authorities, pressing them to adopt the more stringent opinion, which would allow authorities to refrain from exempting the poor.},

One salient theme in the military, political and social history of the eastern Islamic world of the late Middle Ages and early modern period is the alteration and even tension between nomadic and standing armies. With the advent of the Mongol period in Iran, one may encounter an army of Inner Asian origin, with both similarities and differences between it and the original Turcoman army of the Saljuqs. The Mongols introduced a larger scale of armies and fighting, and this in turn influenced at least some of their enemies who were one of their main adversaries in the Middle East in the period after 1260. The demands of the Mongol administration were quite onerous, and contributed in many places to a decline in the economy, agricultural and urban.},

  abstract = {Stemmatology, or the reconstruction of the transmission history of texts, is a field that stands particularly to gain from digital methods. Many scholars already take stemmatic approaches that rely heavily on computational analysis of the collated text (e.g. Robinson and O’Hara 1996; Salemans 2000; Heikkilä 2005; Windram et al. 2008 among many others). Although there is great value in computationally assisted stemmatology, providing as it does a reproducible result and allowing access to the relevant methodological process in related fields such as evolutionary biology, computational stemmatics is not without its critics. The current state-of-the-art effectively forces scholars to choose between a preconceived judgment of the significance of textual differences (the Lachmannian or neo-Lachmannian approach, and the weighted phylogenetic approach) or to make no judgment at all (the unweighted phylogenetic approach). Some basis for judgment of the significance of variation is sorely needed for medieval text criticism in particular. By this, we mean that there is a need for a statistical empirical profile of the text-genealogical significance of the different sorts of variation in different sorts of medieval texts. The rules that apply to copies of Greek and Latin classics may not apply to copies of medieval Dutch story collections; the practices of copying authoritative texts such as the Bible will most likely have been different from the practices of copying the Lives of local saints and other commonly adapted texts. It is nevertheless imperative that we have a consistent, flexible, and analytically tractable model for capturing these phenomena of transmission. In this article, we present a computational model that captures most of the phenomena of text variation, and a method for analysis of one or more stemma hypotheses against the variation model. We apply this method to three ‘artificial traditions’ (i.e. texts copied under laboratory conditions by scholars to study the properties of text variation) and four genuine medieval traditions whose transmission history is known or deduced in varying degrees. Although our findings are necessarily limited by the small number of texts at our disposal, we demonstrate here some of the wide variety of calculations that can be made using our model. Certain of our results call sharply into question the utility of excluding ‘trivial’ variation such as orthographic and spelling changes from stemmatic analysis.},

  abstract = {The frequencies of individual words have been the mainstay of computer-assisted authorial attribution over the past three decades. The usefulness of this sort of data is attested in many benchmark trials and in numerous studies of particular authorship problems. It is sometimes argued, however, that since language as spoken or written falls into word sequences, on the ‘idiom principle’, and since language is characteristically produced in the brain in chunks, not in individual words, n-grams with n higher than 1 are superior to individual words as a source of authorship markers. In this article, we test the usefulness of word n-grams for authorship attribution by asking how many good-quality authorship markers are yielded by n-grams of various types, namely 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, and 5-grams. We use two ways of formulating the n-grams, two corpora of texts, and two methods for finding and assessing markers. We find that when using methods based on regularly occurring markers, and drawing on all the available vocabulary, 1-grams perform best. With methods based on rare markers, and all the available vocabulary, strict 3-gram sequences perform best. If we restrict ourselves to a defined word-list of function-words to form n-grams, 2-grams offer a striking improvement on 1-grams.},

  location = {{London}},
  abstract = {Mapping the Middle East explores the many perspectives from which people have visualized the vast area lying between the Atlantic Ocean and the Oxus and Indus river valleys over the past millennium. By analysing maps produced from the eleventh century on, Zayde Antrim emphasizes the deep roots of mapping in a world region too often considered unexamined and unchanging before the modern period. Indeed, maps from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, coinciding with the eras of European colonialism and the rise of the nation-state, have obscured this deeper past and constrained future possibilities. Mapping the Middle East is organized chronologically to contextualize and interpret compelling maps from each period. Chapters address the medieval `Realm of Islam', the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire, French and British colonial mapping over the long nineteenth century, national mapping traditions in modern Turkey, Iran and Israel/Palestine, and alternative geographies in twentieth- and twenty-first-century maps.

  abstract = {"Provocative yet sober, Digital Critical Editions examines how transitioning from print to a digital milieu deeply affects how scholars deal with the work of editing critical texts. On one hand, forces like changing technology and evolving reader expectations lead to the development of specific editorial products, while on the other hand, they threaten traditional forms of knowledge and methods of textual scholarship. Using the experiences of philologists, text critics, text encoders, scientific editors, and media analysts, Digital Critical Editions ranges from philology in ancient Alexandria to the vision of user-supported online critical editing, from peer-directed texts distributed to a few to community-edited products shaped by the many. The authors discuss the production and accessibility of documents, the emergence of tools used in scholarly work, new editing regimes, and how the readers' expectations evolve as they navigate digital texts. The goal: exploring questions such as, What kind of text is produced? Why is it produced in this particular way? Digital Critical Editions provides digital editors, researchers, readers, and technological actors with insights for addressing disruptions that arise from the clash of traditional and digital cultures, while also offering a practical roadmap for processing traditional texts and collections with today's state-of-the-art editing and research techniques thus addressing readers' new emerging reading habits" "Critical editions are going on-line, but not without intense controversy. Digital Critical Editions investigates how the transition from the print-based humanities to various forms of digital presentations affects not only the way scholarly editors deal with the practicalities of critical text editing, but also, in a deeper way, various conceptions about the nature of texts and their transmission. To explore the transition fully, it combines the experience of philologists, text critics, text encoders, scientific editors, and analysts of the digital turn, to set the searchlight on the future of philology's crown jewel - scholarly editing. It tackles a wide range of issues, offering the reader a deep view of editorial traditions and practices, from ancient Alexandrian philology to cutting-edge issues in text mark-up, from the Lachmannian revolution in textual criticism to visions about user-supported online critical editing, and from narrowly distributed peer-directed products to community-oriented broad products. The book bridges the expertise of philologists and new kinds of reading practices in cyberspace. It offers digital editors and prospective digital editors a sober description of state-of-the-art techniques and standards of text encoding grammars and transformation mechanisms. It does not dwell on arcane theoretical issues, nor on highly technical text mark-up considerations but instead attempts to extend the benefits already achieved to new kinds of texts and collections"},

By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project. Throughout, the focus is on moving beyond the bag-of-words, lexical frequency model by incorporating linguistically-driven analyses in research.},

As a result, I offer a fresh look at monasticism as an organic component of the rural landscape and at the rural monk as a domestic villager rather than a revered role model for society.},

It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr. Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80-100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion, and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes"--},

However, there is still no agreement on which methods are best suited for particular settings and, moreover, there is no reliable comparison of already developed methods. We believe that one of the main reasons is the lack of state-of-the-art method implementations, which are usually non-trivial to recreate—mostly, in terms of software engineering efforts. In order to address these issues, we present ATR4S, an open-source software written in Scala that comprises 13 state-of-the-art methods for automatic terminology recognition (ATR) and implements the whole pipeline from text document preprocessing, to term candidates collection, term candidate scoring, and finally, term candidate ranking. It is highly scalable, modular and configurable tool with support of automatic caching. We also compare 13 state-of-the-art methods on 7 open datasets by average precision and processing time. Experimental comparison reveals that no single method demonstrates best average precision for all datasets and that other available tools for ATR do not contain the best methods.},

By examining these catalogs in terms of the wider historical significance of their materiality, specifically their organization, layout, typography and illustrations, in this essay I show how these booklets promoted the \textsc{AMP} and its mission’s entangled messages in an increasingly competitive publishing industry. On the one hand, the catalogs highlighted the \textsc{AMP}’s ‘western’ qualifications and strove to engage local readers’ interests in ‘modern’ culture, science and technology. On the other hand, these works marketed the mission’s universalist evangelical views. Thus, in this study I show how such ephemeral publications, when studied for their dynamic content, make evident nineteenth-century Arabic print commerce at work and also illustrate early examples of nascent advertising practices.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Careful evaluation shows that some of the classifiers we define are, indeed, highly accurate, and scale up nicely to domains that they were not trained on. In addition, analysis of the best features provides insight into the morphological properties of translated texts.},

  abstract = {The spread of foreign languages, especially French, under European colonial rule inspired certain Arabic writers and scholars in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century to look at ways to develop the Arabic language. This happened because they felt that foreign languages had started to overtake Arabic because they were easier to read (ZAKĪ 1901: 2). In this paper, I will discuss the use of punctuation marks in Arabic texts since the mid-nineteenth century as an example of the evolution of Arabic writing due to European influence. I will explain the reasons why punctuation marks were integrated into Arabic texts, quoting Arabic writers and scholars from the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. These include Zaynab Fawwāz, the first writer to address the issue of punctuation marks in Arabic writings (FAWWĀZ 2007: 105-107), and ʾAḥmad Zakī who officially integrated punctuation into the Arabic language (ZAKĪ 1912). I will also explain the opposition that came from conservative scholars who were reluctant to change any aspect of Arabic writing. This is because they believed in the sanctity of Arabic as it is the language of the Qurʾān and it represents Arabic identity. Therefore, one should avoid any “borrowing” from colonial languages in order to preserve Arabic identity (MEYNET 1971: 94).Keywords: Punctuation, Arabic writing, ʾAḥmad Zakī, printing, Arabic Renaissance / an-Nahḍa al-ʿarabiyya, transmission of knowledge},

The proposed method uses the distributional semantics to build the word-context matrix representing the distribution of words across contexts and to transform the text into a vector space model (VSM) representation based on word semantic similarity. The linguistic features of the Arabic language, in addition to the semantic information extracted from different lexical-semantic resources such as Arabic WordNet and named entities’ gazetteers are used to improve the text representation and to create word clusters of similar and related words. Distributional similarity measures have been used to capture the words’ semantic similarity and to create clusters of similar words. The conducted experiments have shown that the proposed method significantly reduces the size of text representation by about 27 \% compared with the stem-based VSM and by about 50 \% compared with the traditional bag-of-words model. Their results have shown that the amount of dimension reduction depends on the size and shape of the windows of analysis as well as on the content of the text.},

This article examines a small section of this scene: the growth, spreading and changing characteristics of book dealerships and bookshops in the Arab Ottoman provinces during the formative half-century prior to World War I. Exploring this mechanism casts light on the nature and pace of printing assimilation in the region, projecting it as a rather dramatic makeover.]},

We still know surprisingly little about premodern learned women, particularly from the eastern Iranian world. This article describes one female mystic, Umm ʿAlī, who flourished in ninth-century Balkh and has so far eluded modern scholarship. A historiographical study of her provides insight into how the representations of mystical women changed over time. From the earlier sources, we learn that Umm ʿAlī applied creative and interesting strategies that provided her access to the highest sources of learning. Umm ʿAlī’s case also allows for some tentative conclusions on the importance of pedigree, and the practice of strategic marriages that connect local power-holders with the ʿulamāʾ.},

  abstract = {The Arab grammarians differentiate between the ziyāda (augment) that introduces~an element of meaning and the ziyāda that appends (yulḥiq) one~morphological form to another. Having realized the potential of the concept~of ilḥāq (appending) as an analytical tool in morphology, the grammarians~divided appended words into several types according to the number of the~radicals in their roots and the type of ziyāda that is involved, and tried to~justify forms and patterns with reference to a set of detailed rules which~they elaborately describe. This paper deals with the issues the grammarians~tackle in their study of ilḥāq, such as its purpose, the possibility of analogically~extending its examples, and the inapplicability of idġām (gemination)~to its patterns. It also examines how the grammarians use ilḥāq to reduce~considerably the number of morphological patterns that form a closed~system, to explain away anomalous and rare patterns, and thus to limit~deviation from the norm (qiyās) and to test the validity of a host of morphological~issues.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that processing information in one sensory modality can either be enhanced or attenuated by concurrent stimulation of another modality. Here, we reconcile these apparently contradictory results by showing that the sign of cross-modal interactions depends on whether the content of two modalities is associated or not. When concurrently presented auditory and visual stimuli are paired by chance, cue-induced preparatory neural activity is strongly enhanced in the task-relevant sensory system and suppressed in the irrelevant system. Conversely, when information in the two modalities is reliably associated, activity is enhanced in both systems regardless of which modality is task relevant. Our findings illustrate an ecologically optimal flexibility of the neural mechanisms that govern multisensory processing: facilitation occurs when integration is expected, and suppression occurs when distraction is expected. Because thalamic structures were more active when the senses needed to operate separately, we propose them to serve gatekeeper functions in early cross-modal interactions.},

Yet it has rarely been considered by social or cultural anthropologists, who represent the largest subfield of the discipline. In this powerful study Alan Barnard aims to bridge this gap. Barnard argues that social anthropological theory has much to contribute to our understanding of human evolution, including changes in technology, subsistence and exchange, family and kinship, as well as to the study of language, art, ritual and belief. This book places social anthropology in the context of a widely-conceived constellation of anthropological sciences. It incorporates recent findings in many fields, including primate studies, archaeology, linguistics and human genetics. In clear, accessible style Barnard addresses the fundamental questions surrounding the evolution of human society and the prehistory of culture, suggesting a new direction for social anthropology that will open up debate across the discipline as a whole"--},

  abstract = {We present the methodological and technical process we adopted to develop DanteSources, a Web application that allows free access to the knowledge about Dante Alighieri’s primary sources, i.e. the works of other authors that Dante cites in his texts. Up to now, this knowledge has been collected in many paper books, making it difficult for the scholars to retrieve it and to produce a complete overview of these data. Using Semantic Web technologies, we developed an ontology expressed in the Resource Description Framework Schema vocabulary providing the terms to represent this knowledge in a machine-readable form. A semi-automatic tool helps the scholars to populate the ontology with the data included in authoritative paper commentaries to Dante’s works. Then, the tool automatically saves the resulting Resource Description Framework graph in a triple store. On top of this graph, we developed DanteSources, a Web application that allows users to extract and display the information stored in the knowledge base in the form of charts and tables. Finally, we report the results of a survey to collect suggestions from end-users on their interactions with DanteSources. The methodology and the tools we developed are easily reusable, e.g. to represent the knowledge about primary sources of other authors of the Italian and the international literature.},

  abstract = {The greatest impact of Islam on history has been cultural yet, this aspect of Islamic history has been neglected in comparison to political and judicial history. V.V. Bartold, the Russian historian was one of the first scholars to project Muslim culture. In this world, Bartold gave primacy to clarity and the organization of knowledge. He posits the position of Islam in world history to the position of Christianity as a cultural force in both the Roman and the eastern worlds. Bartold's Russian vantage made him a specialist on Islam in Central Asia; hence Ajam culture, Persian in the first instance, and Turco-Mongol in the second, find their proper place, with the result that the Abbasid and post-Abbasid Muslim cultures find their proper place. The Mongol invasion is not treated merely as destruction and disruption of Muslim culture, but also as a factor which affected late medieval culture. Most of the great exponents of Muslim culture, Ibn Khaldun and Avicenna are covered. Bartold concludes with remarking on the effect on his native Russia of the passing of cultural leadership from the East to the West. This monograph is remarkable for retaining its relevance and validity after almost a whole century and a host of intervening specialised works in the intervening period. This work was translated four years after the author's death by Shahid Suhrawardy, an eminent scholar in his own right, and the Foreword has been written by Sir Hassan Suhrawardy, then Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University.},

It shows that from the late Sasanian period on, and accelerating in the early Islamic period, there was a relatively unrestricted functioning of markets for goods, labour, and capital. This stimulated market exchange, associated with growing monetization of the economy, especially in the towns, but also in the countryside, even though coercion remained more pronounced there. We hypothesize that these developments brought economic dynamism but simultaneously increased inequality and furthered the rise of new, powerful elite groups, causing the decline of the same markets.},

Two social housing projects in İzmir are chosen as case studies as an initial step to be developed toward a potentially international digital platform. The theoretical premises of the project are based on the renowned cultural theorist Henri Lefebvre’s Spatial Triad, which distinguishes between representations of space, representational spaces or spaces of representation, and spatial practices. Following this framework, the collected data are organized in three sections, which are reflected in the digital interface. These are respectively titled, ‘implementations’, which contains architectural drawings and visual recordings of interviews with the chief architect of the projects; ‘perceptions’, which includes related texts that are scanned from Web sites, newspapers, journals, and conference proceedings; and ‘lived experiences’, which contains photographs and visual records of on-site interviews with the users of the two housing estates. Users of the digital interface are enabled access to data in each category by means of choosing one of eighty-three related keywords. The latter are derived from the digital analyses of discursive material. By enabling the comparison of the sections of spatial data for each settlement and between the two settlements, the digital platform has the potential to inform decision-making processes in future social housing projects.},

Quanzhou/Zaitun bore the key hallmarks of Islamic presence in China between the eighth and thirteenth centuries. The Mongols populated their newly built observatory in Khanbaliq with astronomers brought in from the Islamic world, where astronomy and mathematics were the most advanced in the world. The Nanjing phase, which corresponds quite closely to the rise of the Ming dynasty in the fourteenth century, is a turning point in the Chinese Muslim history. Whereas the Nanjing phase of Chinese Islamic history was mostly cultural in nature, the final phase of Lanzhou and Xinjiang is marked by a mixture of cultural shifts, military activity and violence.},

The Sanhaja Almoravids emerged from the Sahara in the 1050s to conquer vast territories and halt the Christian advance in Iberia. They were replaced a century later by their rivals, the Almohads, supported by the Masmuda Berbers of the High Atlas. Although both have often been seen as uncouth, religiously intolerant tribesmen who undermined the high culture of al-Andalus, this book argues that the eleventh to thirteenth centuries were crucial to the Islamisation of the Maghrib, its integration into the Islamic cultural sphere, and its emergence as a key player in the western Mediterranean, and that much of this was due to these oft-neglected Berber empires},

  abstract = {This paper explores the image of the ʿAbbasid caliphate in the Islamic west from the Umayyad era until the rise of the Almoravids, the first major Maghribī dynasty to give their allegiance to the ʿAbbasids. Despite the Umayyads' studied refusal to acknowledge the ʿAbbasids as true caliphs, many scholars have mentioned the introduction of courtly norms, poetic forms, and scientific knowledge from Iraq from the early ninth century CE onwards and the appearance of artefacts of supposed ʿAbbasid provenance in Umayyad Cordoba. One of the most renowned of these was the necklace of al-Shifāʾ, one of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān II's concubines, which Ibn Ḥayyān describes as an ʿAbbasid treasure lost during the great civil war between al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn. One theory is that this real or symbolic acquisition of eastern items indicated the ʿAbbasidisation of the Umayyad regime. This paper, however, argues that the borrowing that occurred was often rather haphazard and that while the east certainly could represent wealth, glamour and high culture, the Umayyads were still at pains to delegitimise the ʿAbbasids as a dynasty and vaunt their own religio-political credentials. Moreover, the term ʿAbbasidisation is too broad and subsumes a range of different processes of exchange taking place in Fusṭāṭ, Medina, Baghdad and Cordoba itself, some conscious and some less so. A similar pattern appears in relation to Almoravid relations with the ʿAbbasids: while the Almoravids recognised rather than rejected ʿAbbasid sovereignty, they also did so to enhance their own domestic legitimacy in the Islamic west and the actual contacts they had with Baghdad were similarly serendipitous rather than planned. Both these examples encourage us to think more deeply about the nature of centre-periphery relations in medieval Islam, and give texture to our understanding of how contacts were made and sustained across the vast domains of the Dār al-Islām.},

  abstract = {When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the suspicious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagiarism detection, but their performance depends on the way they are exploited.},

There were some in our own corner of the profession blazing new methodological trails—Clifford Geertz, for example, who, though not a historian, had much to say to historians, and whose books were read eagerly by historians, and not just in Middle Eastern history; or Fedwa Malti-Douglas, as much at home in feminist literary theory as in medieval Arabic literature. But many graduate students in Middle Eastern history felt a bit underrepresented on the cutting edge of historical thought and practice.},

By means of resampling procedures, the present study shows that when used in this context, the chi-squared test produces far too many significant results, even in its modified version.

The paper first surveys the methodological characteristics of corpus-driven research and then contrasts the linguistic characteristics of two types of multi-word sequences: ‘multi-word lexical collocations’ (combinations of content words) versus ‘multi-word formulaic sequences’ (incorporating both function words and content words). 	Building on this background, the primary focus of the paper is an empirical investigation of the ‘patterns’ represented by multi-word formulaic sequences. It turns out that the multi-word patterns typical of speech are fundamentally different from those typical of academic writing: patterns in conversation tend to be fixed sequences (including both function words and content words). In contrast, most patterns in academic writing are formulaic frames consisting of invariable function words with an intervening variable slot that is filled by content words.},

  abstract = {Studies of the memory capabilities of nonhuman primates have consistently revealed a relative weakness for auditory compared to visual or tactile stimuli: extensive training is required to learn auditory memory tasks, and subjects are only capable of retaining acoustic information for a brief period of time. Whether a parallel deficit exists in human auditory memory remains an outstanding question. In the current study, a short-term memory paradigm was used to test human subjects’ retention of simple auditory, visual, and tactile stimuli that were carefully equated in terms of discriminability, stimulus exposure time, and temporal dynamics. Mean accuracy did not differ significantly among sensory modalities at very short retention intervals (1–4 s). However, at longer retention intervals (8–32 s), accuracy for auditory stimuli fell substantially below that observed for visual and tactile stimuli. In the interest of extending the ecological validity of these findings, a second experiment tested recognition memory for complex, naturalistic stimuli that would likely be encountered in everyday life. Subjects were able to identify all stimuli when retention was not required, however, recognition accuracy following a delay period was again inferior for auditory compared to visual and tactile stimuli. Thus, the outcomes of both experiments provide a human parallel to the pattern of results observed in nonhuman primates. The results are interpreted in light of neuropsychological data from nonhuman primates, which suggest a difference in the degree to which auditory, visual, and tactile memory are mediated by the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices.},

This change was more than a convenience. It was transformative. Database represents a new form of textuality, and scholars have come to rely on database's affordances to develop new ways of reading. In addition to content analysis of claims made about database in various fora, modest bibliometric analysis of two journals (American Literature and English Literary History) suggests trends: more and more diverse primary texts are being read and cited. Interviews with authors of journal articles and journal editors are used to characterize how the databases are used and the effect on scholarship.},

We argue that the relationship between quantitative methods and qualitative interpretation can be reframed by investigating the long history of machine learning procedures and their historical antecedents. The new method of visualization presented by the Networked Corpus enables users to compare the results of topic models with earlier methods of topical representation such as the 18th-century subject index. Although the article provides a brief description of the tool, the primary focus is to describe an argument for this kind of comparative analysis between topic models and older genres that perform similar tasks. Such comparative analysis provides a new method for developing conceptual histories of the categories of meaning on which the topic model and the index depend. These devices are linked by a shared attempt to represent what a text is ‘about’, but the concept of ‘aboutness’ has evolved over time. The Networked Corpus enables researchers to discover congruities and contradictions in how topic models and indexes represent texts in order to examine what kinds of information each historically situated device prioritizes.},

How do scholars attempt to unpack it and make connections in a responsible manner?  ~ While the topics of historiography and historical methodology have become increasingly popular, Bloch remains an authority. He argues that history is a whole; no period and no topic can be understood except in relation to other periods and topics. And what is unique about Bloch is that he puts his theories into practice; for example, calling upon both his experience serving in WWI as well as his many years spent in peaceful study and reflection. He also argues that written records are not enough; a historian must draw upon maps, place-names, ancient tools, aerial surveys, folklore, and everything that is available.  ~ This is a work that argues constantly for a wider, more human history. For a history that describes how and why people live and work together. There is a living, breathing connection between the past and the present and it is the historian’s responsibility to do it justice.},

One is the rise of digital media: websites, videogames, social media, and mobile applications, as well as all the remediations of film, television, radio, and print that now appear in digital form. The other development is the end of our collective belief in what we might call Culture with a capital C. Since the middle of the twentieth century, traditional hierarchies of the visual arts, literature, and music as forms of creativity have broken down. This has been accompanied by a decline in the status of the humanities--literary studies in particular, but also history and philosophy. Jay Bolter's THE PLENITUDE is the story of how the dissolution of previously sacrosanct media institutions succumbed to the pervasive power of new forms of media. It is not an argument favoring an elite form of culture over popular culture, but rather a examination of how these changes have affected the divided societies we live in today"--},

With Samarra and Baghdad absorbed by inner conflict in the 860s and trying to recover from it during the following decades, most of the empire fell apart. Having acted as chief commander for al-Muqtazz's side during the civil war of 865, he enjoyed the respect of the soldiers. Brett sees ninth-century Ismailism as part of a larger brew of oppositional trends, the 'sectarian milieu' which John Wansbrough described as the religious and doctrinal environment of early Islam. Al-Mutadid achieved a reputation and popularity that went beyond the army, and his reign constituted the high point of what is known as the 'Abbasid restoration'. The decline of Abbasid power was felt throughout the Islamic world. A powerless Abbasid caliphate was still indispensable to the Buyids for several reasons, including their need for formal legitimacy.},

The illustration we provide comes from early Islamic North Africa. We postulate that during the Medieval period two widely different sociopolitical contexts existed, giving rise to diverse urban patterns. Most importantly, we argue that the second of these patterns represents a widespread situation that is inadequately treated in the literature.},

  abstract = {In the 'encyclopaedic' fourteenth century, Arabic chronicles produced in Mamluk cities bore textual witness to both recent and bygone history, including that of the Fatimids (969–1171CE). For in two centuries of rule over Egypt and North Africa, the Isma'ili Fatimids had left few self-generated historiographical records. Instead, it fell to Ayyubid and Mamluk historians to represent the dynasty to posterity. This monograph sets out to explain how later historians preserved, interpreted and re-organised earlier textual sources.Mamluk historians engaged in a sophisticated archival practice within historiography, rather than uncritically reproducing earlier reports. In a new diplomatic edition, translation and analysis of Mamluk historian Ibn al-Furat's account of late Fatimid rule in The History of Dynasties and Kings, a widely known but barely copied universal chronicle of Islamic history, Fozia Bora traces the survival of historiographical narratives from Fatimid Egypt. Through Ibn al-Furat's text, Bora demonstrates archivality as the heuristic key to Mamluk historical writing.This book is essential for all scholars working on the written culture and history of the medieval Islamic world, and paves the way for a more nuanced reading of pre-modern Arabic chronicles and of the epistemic environment in which they were produced.},

It also contends that scholars have tended to ignore the fact that this periodization was first and foremost an Abbasid claim to power. It investigates the Abbasid-era construction of the past and demonstrates that alternative periodizations were used prior to these massive efforts to enclose the past into a rigid structure, and so it sheds light on forgotten alternative pasts. The links between periodization and space are emphasized, focusing on the example of early Islamic Syria. Indeed, this province largely vanished from the map with the coming of the Abbasids to power since Syria’s memory came to be limited to its Umayyad past. Elaborating upon alternative periodizations, the paper offers a fresh attempt at a history of the meanings (Sinngeschichte) of a long Syrian eighth century, articulated around memory and power.},

Focusing on the interplay of myth, memory, and place, it begins with the Kymin, a hillside site outside the Welsh border town of Monmouth. In about 1800 this site was carefully remodelled to invest it with a series of meanings--urban/rural, enlightened/romantic, Welsh/English/British--through which those who visited it were able to explore and express their ambivalent identities. The eighteenth-century spa of Bath was also "symbolic territory", and in one of its iconic structures, the Circus, myth, memory, and place combined to allow the elite to examine similar issues of identity to those at the Kymin. Central to the mythical element in both sites was the notion of the hero. It was an idea that was to resurface on a grand scale in late Victorian and Edwardian Bath, as the city's historic fabric was reconfigured as a "mausoleum" to Britain's Georgian imperial heroes. The paper concludes by arguing that the identities examined in the paper were closely tied to ones of social class, and that the way forward for social history is a fusion of the cultural and the structural that emphasizes the interaction between the two.},

Using a large new city-specific data set covering Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, we unravel the role of geography and institutions in determining long-run city development in the two regions. We find that the main reasons for the Islamic world's stagnation and Europe's long-term success are specific to each region: any significant positive interaction between cities in the two regions hampered by their different main religious orientation. Together, the long-term consequences of a different choice of main transport mode (camel versus ship) and the development of forms of local participative government in Europe that made cities less dependent on the state explain why Europe's urban development eventually outpaced that in the Islamic world.},

We study and compare existent works in several fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Knowledge Extraction (KE). Thus, we illicit their main drawbacks and identify some perspectives, which may be considered by the research community. We also study the characteristics of these types of documents, by enumerating the advantages/limits of using hadith as a language resource. Moreover, our study shows that previous studies used different collections of hadiths, thus making it hard to compare their results objectively. Besides, many preprocessing steps are recurrent through these applications, thus wasting a lot of time. Consequently, the key issues for building generic language resources from hadiths are discussed, taking into account the relevance of related literature and the wide community of researchers that are interested in these narrations. The ultimate goal is to structure hadith books for multiple usages, thus building common collections which may be exploited in future applications.},

The approach is heavily motivated by real-world time series, and by developing a complete approach to model building, estimation, forecasting and control." -~~~~~~~ Mathematical Reviews Bridging classical models and modern topics, the Fifth Edition of Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control maintains a balanced presentation of the tools for modeling and analyzing time series. Also describing ~the latest developments that have occurred in the field over the past decade through applications from areas such as business, finance, and engineering, the Fifth Edition continues to serve as one of the most influential and prominent works on the subject. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition provides a clearly written exploration of the key methods for building, classifying, testing, and analyzing stochastic models for time series and describes their use in five important areas of application: forecasting; determining the transfer function of a system; modeling the effects of intervention events; developing multivariate dynamic models; and designing simple control schemes.~ Along with these classical uses, the new edition covers modern topics with new features that include:  A redesigned chapter on multivariate time series analysis with an expanded treatment of Vector Autoregressive, or VAR models, along with a discussion of the analytical tools needed for modeling vector time series An expanded chapter on special topics covering~ unit root testing,~ time-varying volatility~ models such as ARCH and GARCH, nonlinear time series models, and long memory models Numerous examples drawn from finance, economics, engineering, and other related fields The use of the publicly available R software for graphical illustrations and numerical calculations along with scripts that demonstrate the use of R for model building and forecasting Updates to literature references throughout and new end-of-chapter exercises Streamlined chapter introductions and revisions that update and enhance the exposition  Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition is a valuable real-world reference for researchers and practitioners in time series analysis, econometrics, finance, and related fields. The book is also an excellent textbook for beginning graduate-level courses in advanced statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, engineering, and physics.},

Al-Ṣafadī's biography of the lady provides a rare glance into the life of women of the Mongol royal household during the transitional period which followed the Ilkhanid conversion to Islam. It sheds light on issues such as the relations between the Mamluks and the Ilkhans in light of the latter's conversion to Islam and the influence of the process of Islamization on traditional Mongolian gender related practices. This paper also discusses the motivation of the Mamluk author in including El Qutlugh's unusual story in his biographical dictionaries showing how his choices might have been influenced not only by his own interests but also by what appealed to his readers.},

  abstract = {Humanities Computing (HC) has been in existence since the beginning of computing, and was originally created as an attempt to transform aspects of humanities scholarship – a goal that it retains today. It would seem, however, that to date this central aim has not been achieved. In this paper we argue that HC might be more influential if it moved its operations closer to traditional scholarly methods. To illustrate the issue, we describe four usage paradigms for computing in humanities research. We argue that the conduit model is the one in the minds of most scholars who use computing to support their research today – a model which supports established practice but fails in important ways to take advantage of much of what computing could offer. In contrast, the HC community is much more interested in two other models (labelled here as the transformation and markup models) both of which, it is argued, do not connect well with the activities traditionally associated with the majority of humanities scholarship. We therefore propose a fourth model, the object manipulation model, which we believe is able to take better advantage of the possibilities computers provide to research than the conduit model and is, like it, more closely based on actual majority scholarly practice. We also mention that other models (such as those arising from the work of Druker and McGann) are also possible, and worthy of serious consideration within the HC community.},

  abstract = {One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92\%, 88\%, and 87\%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.},

Ifrīqiya was the old Byzantine province of Africa. The difference between the two histories apparent in the difference between the sources goes back to the departure of the Fāṭimid caliph al-Mu˓izz for Egypt in 361/972, leaving his central Mediterranean empire divided into two provinces under viceroys of different provenance. The Norman occupation of the coast of Ifrīqiya, which centred on the capture of al-Mahdiyya in 543/1148 and ended with the fall of the city to the Almohads in 555/1160, terminated the efforts of the Zīrids to regain a measure of power and authority after their flight from Qayrawān.},

The end of the Arab supremacy was complete when in 219/834 the Arabs were struck from the diwan, the list of those entitled to pay as members of the jund, despite their protest that it was theirs by right. The extirpation of the Tulunids brought the return of Egypt to provincial status with a recrudescence of provincial unrest, immediately manifested in the welcome at Fustat to one ibn al-Khalij, or al-Khaliji. Ibn Tughj had no difficulty in returning to Syria to secure its possession, and reconstitute the empire created by Ibn Tulun when he invaded Syria from Egypt. Like that of the Tulunids, that of the Ikhshidids was a ghulam state, in which the payment of the army was central to the administration. After the retreat from Alexandria in 324/936 the threat of Fatimid invasion receded.},

Trade was to be conducted as far as possible in accordance with the Law, and approval was given to the establishment of Muslim communities in the Bilād al-Sūdān under the authority of a nāẓir or 'watchman', with the consent of the pagan king of the country. The formation of Muslim communities on this legal basis, and their incorporation into the pattern of West African society, were important for the subsequent character of Islam in West Africa. Meanwhile, among the 'stateless' Berber peoples of the Western Sahara, the doctrines of the Malikite school were subject to a different interpretation by Ibn Yāsīn, which came into open conflict with the views of al-Qābisī when the Almoravids sacked the Muslim city of Awdaghast for submitting to the pagan king of Ghana. This conflict of attitudes to paganism remained a feature of West African Islam down to the twentieth century.},

The outcome, in the Ottoman empire, was an impressive solution to the problem of state formation and organisation inherent in the kinds of government. Only to the south, across the Sahara in tropical Africa, were the terms of the problem modified by the relationship of Muslims to pagans in lands where they had established themselves by settlement and conversion rather than by conquest. The Arabs, Turks and Berbers who invaded the settled lands of Islam in the fifth/eleventh century were all tribal peoples of the kind described by Ibn Khaldūn.},

Because life history theory focuses on the timing of, and energetic investment in, particular aspects of physiology, such as growth and reproduction, Richard Bribiescas and his fellow anthropologists are now using it in the study of humans. This has led to an increased understanding of human female physiology - especially growth and reproduction - from an evolutionary and life history perspective. However, little attention has been directed toward these characteristics in males. Men provides a new understanding of human male physiology and applies it to contemporary health issues such as prostate cancer, testosterone replacement therapy, and the development of a male contraceptive." "Men proves that understanding human physiology requires global research in traditionally overlooked areas and that evolutionary and life history theory have much to offer toward this endeavor."--Jacket.},

Modern media are replete with alarm over jihad, underage marriage and the threat of amputation or stoning under Shariah law.  Sometimes rumor, sometimes based in fact and often misunderstood, the tenets of Islamic law and dogma were not set in the religion’s founding moments. They were developed over centuries by the clerical class of Muslim scholars.Misquoting Muhammad takes the reader back in time through Islamic civilization and traces how and why such controversies developed, offering an inside view into how key and controversial aspects of Islam took shape. From the protests of the Arab Spring to Istanbul at the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and from the ochre red walls of Delhi’s great mosques to the trade routes of Islam’s Indian Ocean world, Misquoting Muhammad lays out how Muslim intellectuals have sought to balance reason and revelation, weigh science and religion, and negotiate the eternal truths of scripture amid shifting values.},

It will do this through a case study that aims to trace the adoption of formal network methods by archaeologists. A review of the archaeological literature will be confronted with an analysis of a citation network consisting of 33,556 publications and 42,993 citations. The results indicate that a citation network analysis succeeds in quantitatively expressing the intuitive results drawn from the literature review. It also allows for the archaeological literature to be re-contextualized in a larger multidisciplinary body of literature. However, the use of citation network analysis for archaeology is significantly restricted by the limitations of the available citation databases, which are still less representative for the humanities and the social sciences than for the natural sciences. It is suggested that different disciplines in the humanities require distinct strategies for citation data collection and analysis.},

In the course of the paper, some aspects and problems of chapter 11 of version 2.0.0 of TEI P5 (the definition and use of the elements {$<$}line{$>$} and {$<$}mod{$>$} and related issues) will be discussed.},

  abstract = {"In an age of big data, data journalism and with a wealth of quantitative information around us, it is not enough for students to be taught only 100 year old statistical methods using 'out of the box' software. They need to have 21st-century analytical skills too. This is an excellent and student-friendly text from two of the world leaders in the teaching and development of spatial analysis. It shows clearly why the open source software R is not just an alternative to commercial GIS, it may actually be the better choice for mapping, analysis and for replicable research. Providing practical tips as well as fully working code, this is a practical 'how to' guide ideal for undergraduates as well as those using R for the first time. It will be required reading on my own courses." - Richard Harris, Professor of Quantitative Social Science, University of Bristol  R is a powerful open source computing tool that supports geographical analysis and mapping for the many geography and ‘non-geography’ students and researchers interested in spatial analysis and mapping.   This book provides an introduction to the use of R for spatial statistical analysis, geocomputation and the analysis of geographical information for researchers collecting and using data with location attached, largely through increased GPS functionality.   Brunsdon and Comber take readers from ‘zero to hero’ in spatial analysis and mapping through functions they have developed and compiled into R packages. This enables practical R applications in GIS, spatial analyses, spatial statistics, mapping, and web-scraping. Each chapter includes:      Example data and commands for exploring it     Scripts and coding to exemplify specific functionality     Advice for developing greater understanding - through functions such as locator(), View(), and alternative coding to achieve the same ends      Self-contained exercises for students to work through     Embedded code within the descriptive text.   ~This is a definitive 'how to' that takes students - of any discipline - from coding to actual applications and uses of R.

Even if the sources were available to determine the precise percentages of Muslims in the Central Asian, Chinese, Indian or south-eastern populations at any point in time, the characteristics of the faith professed by those Muslims would be seen to change over time.},

This is the likely origin of the printed amulets that have been identified in various collections since the 1890s. If the ṭarsh described by the poets were indeed printblocks, the verses would serve to date medieval Arabic printing and show its geographical extent.

This textbook is our way to share with the DH community the courses and material we prepared for this programme. It is an ideal companion to the online course Scholarly Digital Editions: Manuscripts, Texts and TEI Encoding, freely available on the \#dariahTeach platform.2 If the official Guidelines remain the main resource about the encoding of digital editions in TEI, both this book and the online course offer a different approach by targeting the particular needs of editors of medieval (and more generally manuscript) sources, and translating them into TEI terms.},

As these estimates show, medieval and early modern book production was a dynamic economic sector, with an average annual growth rate of around one percent. Rising production after the middle of the fifteenth century probably resulted from lower book prices and higher literacy. To explain the dynamics of medieval book production, we provide estimates for urbanization rates and for the numbers of universities and monasteries. Monasteries seem to have been most important in the early period, while universities and laypeople dominated the later medieval demand for books.},

The main emphasis of that paper was not on the new procedure but on the broader consequences of our increasing sophistication in making such comparisons and the increasing (although never absolute) reliability of our inferences about authorship. My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the field of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classificatory tasks has not yet been investigated.},

Second, studying the Bedouins can open new perspectives on important debates in Middle Eastern historiography. The paper further contends that the arid lands of the Arab East still need to be explored as a historical region with its own distinct patterns of regional connectivity and political organisation. Finally, we highlight environmental history and the study of emic categories as promising avenues for future research on this region.},

Suggestions are offered as to the value of being able to see synoptically texts which are nominally the same but may vary a little or a lot in their verbal details.

These jurists’ tax policy is explained with reference to Haldon’s concept of the tributary mode of production. It is concluded that according to the jurists, muqāsama favoured a redistribution of surpluses between the state and the landowners which could strengthen relations between the Abbasid state and the powerful landlords in Iraq.},

For both authors, t-tests andlogistic regressions show that the length ofthe words in new works is significantly longerthan that of the old. The principal componentanalyses graphically illustrate the separationbetween old and new texts. The works arecorrectly categorized as old or new with 75 to100\% accuracy and 92\% average accuracy usingdiscriminant analysis-based cross validation. The results imply higher time gap may havepositive impact in separation andcategorization. For Altan a regressionanalysis demonstrates a decrease in averageword length as the age of his column increases. One interesting observation is that for oneword each author has similar preference changesover time.},

  abstract = {This book re-examines the notion of word associations, more precisely collocations. It attempts to come to a potentially more generally applicable definition of collocation and how to best extract, identify and measure collocations. The book highlights the role played by (i) automatic linguistic annotation (part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, etc.), (ii) using semantic criteria to facilitate the identification of collocations, (iii) multi-word structured, instead of the widespread assumption of bipartite collocational structures, for capturing the intricacies of the phenomenon of syntagmatic attraction, (iv) considering collocation and valency as near neighbours in the lexis-grammar continuum and (v) the mathematical properties of statistical association measures in the automatic extraction of collocations from corpora. This book is an ideal guide to the use of statistics in collocation analysis and lexicography, as well as a practical text to the development of skills in the application of computational lexicography. Lexical Collocation Analysis: Advances and Applications begins with a proposal for integrating both collocational and valency phenomena within the overarching theoretical framework of construction grammar. Next the book makes the case for integrating advances in syntactic parsing and in collocational analysis. Chapter 3 offers an innovative look at complementing corpus data and dictionaries in the identification of specific types of collocations consisting of restricted predicate-argument combinations. This strategy complements corpus collocational data with network analysis techniques applied to dictionary entries. Chapter 4 explains the potential of collocational graphs and networks both as a visualization tool and as an analytical technique. Chapter 5 introduces MERGE (Multi-word Expressions from the Recursive Grouping of Elements), a data-driven approach to the identification and extraction of multi-word expressions from corpora. Finally the book concludes with an analysis and evaluation of factors influencing the performance of collocation extraction methods in parsed corpora.},

The history of pearling in the region is reviewed, from the earliest possible references to the mid 20th century. Economic data from the 18th-20th centuries CE is analysed in detail, to define the economic course of the pearling industry during that time, and assess the impact on human settlement in the region. The archaeological data for pearl fishing are then examined, from the 6th millennium BCE onwards, and compared to the historical evidence. The results of archaeological survey in the Abu Dhabi islands region are then taken as a case study, and changes in settlement patterns are related to the historical trajectory of the pearling industry. It is observed that the regional economy became overwhelmingly dependent on the pearl trade in recent centuries, and was increasingly subject to the demands of the global market. /// Cette étude présente une analyse et une synthèse des données historiques et archéologiques sur la pêche des perles dans le Golfe arabo-persique. L'histoire de la pêche des perles dans la région est passée en revue, depuis les plus anciennes références connues qui remontent au milieu du 20e siècle. Les données économiques du 18e au 20e siècle sont analysées en détail pour définir l'évolution de l'industrie perlière pendant cette période et évaluer son incidence sur le peuplement de la région. Les données archéologiques sur la pêche des perles, examinées depuis le 6ème millénaire avant J.-C., ont été comparées aux données historiques. Les résultats des reconnaissances archéologiques dans les îles de la région d'Abu Dhabi sont alors présentées comme étude de cas et les modifications de configuration de l'habitat sont reliées à l'évolution historique de l'industrie perlière. On remarque que l'économie de cette région est devenue presque entièrement dépendante du commerce des perles dans les siècles récents, et qu'elle était de plus en plus assujettie à la demande du marché mondial.},

  abstract = {In recent years, important research on crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage sector has been published, dealing with topics such as the quantity of contributions made by volunteers, the motivations of those who participate in such projects, the design and establishment of crowdsourcing initiatives, and their public engagement value. This article addresses a gap in the literature, and seeks to answer two key questions in relation to crowdsourced transcription: (1) whether volunteers’ contributions are of a high enough standard for creating a publicly accessible database, and for use in scholarly research; and (2) if crowdsourced transcription makes economic sense, and if the investment in launching and running such a project can ever pay off. In doing so, this article takes the award-winning crowdsourced transcription initiative, Transcribe Bentham, which began in 2010, as its case study. It examines a large data set, namely, 4,364 checked and approved transcripts submitted by volunteers between 1 October 2012 and 27 June 2014. These data include metrics such as the time taken to check and approve each transcript, and the number of alterations made to the transcript by Transcribe Bentham staff. These data are then used to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the initiative, and its potential impact upon the ongoing production of The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham at UCL. Finally, the article proposes more general points about successfully planning humanities crowdsourcing projects, and provides a framework in which both the quality of their outputs and the efficiencies of their cost structures can be evaluated.},

I find that the available data provide support for this interpretation and weigh against some of the most plausible alternatives. For example, I show that while Nile shocks increased historical references to social unrest, deviant floods did not increase a proxy for popular religiosity. Together, the results suggest an increase in the political power of religious leaders during periods of economic downturn.},

  abstract = {Since the eighties, social history in France, as in many other countries, slipped from a macro-social to a micro-social viewpoint. Today, questions about the evolution of social history are becoming more radical still: the reduction of the objects has often led to the disappearance of their social dimension. The definition of social history as such has lost its coherence, whether because French social history has opted for prospects borrowed from other national historiographies (for example social history of politics, social history of the State, gender history), or because social history has been contested by other types of history which denied the primary role of social factors: history of representations, cultural history, anthropological history. It is too easy to interpret these evolutions as a "crisis" or a critical turning point. In fact a critical evaluation of recent works shows more a great fecondity of new approaches and new themes: portraits of groups forgotten by standard works (professions, outsiders, aristocracies, and so on), investigations on social relations until now neglected (gender, generations, private life), cross-fertilization of social history with ethnological, cultural, political, linguistic approaches. Competing paradigms borrowed from different social sciences or dividing sociology lead to an impossibility of synthesis as dreamed by Labrousse or Braudel. Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine new ways of cumulating all this analytical new stuff as different inquiries show on mobilities, polemics on gender history in France, proposals of a cultural history of society (R. Chartier), of a socio-history (G. Noiriel), or of a comparative social history (C. Charle). The main issue is to forget the unquestioned framework of traditional periodization or national scale to invent new prospects adapted to the specificity of the chosen theme organizing this global synthesis. The enduring reflection over the crises of nation and phenomena of memories, dominant in French recent scholarship--which has emulated similar researches in neighboring countries--might be also used as a preliminary travail du deuil, to challenge disciplinary borders and the national unconscious which are the eternal and principal brakes on historical imagination, today and yesterday.},

  abstract = {This book documents the creation of the Bichitra Online Tagore Variorum, a publicly accessible database of Rabindranath Tagore's complete works in Bengali and English totaling some 140,000 pages of primary material. Chapters cover innovative aspects of the site, all replicable in other projects: a hyperbibliography; a search engine and hyperconcordance working across the database; and a unique collation program comparing variant texts at three levels. There are also chapters on the special problems of processing manuscripts, and on planning the website. Early chapters take readers through the history of the project, an overview of Tagore’s works, and the Bengali writing system with the challenges of adapting it to electronic form. The name Bichitra, meaning "various" in Bengali, alludes both to the great variety of Tagore’s works and to their various stages of composition. Beyond their literary excellence, they are notable for their sheer quantity, the number of variant forms of a great many items, and their afterlife in translation, often the poet’s own. Seldom if ever has the same writer revised his material and recast it across genres on such a scale.\mbox\mbox{} Tagore won the Nobel Prize in 1913. By its value-added presentation of this range of material, Bichitra can be a model for future databases covering an author’s complete works or other major corpus of texts. It offers vastly expanded access to Tagore’s writings, and enables new kinds of research including computational text analysis. The “book of the website” shows in technical and human terms how researchers with interests in art, literature and technology can collaborate on cultural informatics projects.},

The SPEI reconstruction successfully reflects the dry and wet periods over the past 451 years, and captures a recent wetting trend that generally agrees with the drought reconstructions for the spruce-dominated area. However, some differences between the tree-ring records from spruce-dominated and juniper-dominated areas reflect regional climate differences. The comparison between drought events in the SPEI reconstruction and historical event of Central Asia reveals drought variations have had profound influences on some historical archives over the past several centuries. This study provides the first long-term SPEI reconstruction and drought evaluation from the low-altitude area of Central Asia, contributing to climate change issues in Central Asia.},

Using the methods of network analysis and document clustering, this article analyzes all the inscriptions extant from Song times for local government schools. It reveals a structural schism in the diffusion of ideas between the Upper Yangzi and other regions of the Song. It also demonstrates the growing intellectual influence of Neo-Confucian ideologues that gradually overtook that of renowned prose-writers.

The crusading pope and the Muslim faqīh guide us to a proper comprehension of the Crusades by refusing to judge the entire movement on the basis of the most recent expression of crusading activity, and they allow us to view the Crusades from Rome and Damascus during the formative period of their development.},

This measure is based on the difficulty Americans have learning other languages. The linguistic distance measure is then used in an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among adult immigrants in the USA and Canada. It is shown that, when other determinants of English language proficiency are the same, the greater the measure of linguistic distance, the poorer is the respondent's English language proficiency. This measure can be used in research, evaluation and practitioner analyses, and for diagnostic purposes regarding linguistic minorities in English-speaking countries. The methodology can also be applied to develop linguistic distance measures for other languages.},

We aim at enriching the current theoretical understanding by contextualising digital humanities practices within a semiotic conceptualisation of modelling. A semiotic approach enables us to contextualise modelling in a scholarly framework well suited to humanistic enquiries, forcing us to investigate how models function as signs within specific contexts of production and use. Kralemann and Lattmann’s semiotic model of modelling complemented by Elleström's theories on iconicity are some of the tools we use to inform this semiotic perspective on modelling. We contextualise Kralemann and Lattmann’s theory within modelling practices in digital humanities by using three examples of models representing components and structure of historical artefacts. We show how their model of models can be used to understand and contextualise the models we study and how their classification of model types clarify important aspects of digital humanities modelling practice.},

  abstract = {[The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.]},

Despite the tensions surrounding succession within the Marwanid family, the territorial expansion of the caliphate proceeded apace without any noticeable slowing until the eve of the third fitna. In keeping with the imperial vision established by the time of Abd al-Malik, Marwanid imperial designs were in theory limitless. For all that the Marwanid caliphs saw themselves as God's caliphs, from France to Farghana it was the Syrian tribal armies who were the real world conquerors. The Hijaz and Yemen were excluded from the superprovinces, no doubt because they lacked any active military fronts or waves of settlement. Nowhere can the aspirations of the Marwanid elites be better glimpsed than in the qusur built by caliphs and ashraf throughout the caliphate.},

Cobb overturns previous claims and presents new arguments, such as the idea that the Frankish invasions of the Near East were something of a side-show to the broader internal conflict between Sunnis and Shi'ites in the region. The Race for Paradise moves along two fronts as Cobb stresses that, for medieval Muslims, the contemporaneous Latin Christian expansion throughout the Mediterranean was seen as closely linked to events in the Levant. As a consequence of this expanded geographical range, the book takes a broader chronological range to encompass the campaigns of Spanish kings north of the Ebro and the Norman conquest of Sicily (beginning in 1060), well before Pope Urban II's famous call to the First Crusade in 1095. Finally, The Race for Paradise brilliantly combats the trend to portray the history of the Crusades, particularly the Islamic experience, in simplistic or binary terms. Muslims did not solely experience the Crusades as fanatical warriors or as helpless victims, Cobb writes; as with any other human experience of similar magnitude, the Crusades were experienced in a great variety of ways, ranging from heroic martyrdom, to collaboration, to utter indifference"--},

In some conditions, additional information was provided to help participants with encoding. In every situation, however, auditory memory proved to be systematically inferior to visual memory.

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that musicians outperform nonmusicians on a variety of tasks. Here we provide the first evidence that musicians have superior auditory recognition memory for both musical and nonmusical stimuli, compared to nonmusicians. However, this advantage did not generalize to the visual domain. Previously, we showed that auditory recognition memory is inferior to visual recognition memory. Would this be true even for trained musicians? We compared auditory and visual memory in musicians and nonmusicians using familiar music, spoken English, and visual objects. For both groups, memory for the auditory stimuli was inferior to memory for the visual objects. Thus, although considerable musical training is associated with better musical and nonmusical auditory memory, it does not increase the ability to remember sounds to the levels found with visual stimuli. This suggests a fundamental capacity difference between auditory and visual recognition memory, with a persistent advantage for the visual domain.},

  abstract = {Abstract Economic historians, beginning with Avner Greif, have looked to business letters from the Cairo Geniza to understand how medieval merchants in the Islamic Mediterranean organized business collaboration. They have noticed the prevalence of agency relations, which followed “informal” arrangements, unlike formal partnerships, which employed written contracts. This “method” was called ṣuḥba (“companionship”) in Arabic, and it entailed reciprocal exchange of favors between business “friends.” Much attention has been given to what Greif calls “private order” enforcement of agency contracts, whereby merchants belonging to a “closed” consortium reported instances of cheating or opportunism by a fellow merchant, in place of enforcement by religious courts. However, economic historians relying on the Geniza documents have paid inadequate attention to evolving Jewish law in the Islamic milieu. The present article, focusing on a mercantile dispute, brings evidence to show that Jewish legal scholars adopted a feature of Islamic judicial practice to strengthen their role in enforcement of informal agency contracts. In his Code, the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides put the final touches on this accommodation by incorporating agency into the law pertaining to contract enforcement among partners.},

  publisher = {{Princeton University Press}},
  abstract = {What was it like to be poor in the Middle Ages? In the past, the answer to this question came only from institutions and individuals who gave relief to the less fortunate. This book, by one of the top scholars in the field, is the first comprehensive book to study poverty in a premodern Jewish community--from the viewpoint of both the poor and those who provided for them. Mark Cohen mines the richest body of documents available on the matter: the papers of the Cairo Geniza. These documents, located in the Geniza, a hidden chamber for discarded papers situated in a medieval synagogue in Old Cairo, were preserved largely unharmed for more than nine centuries due to an ancient custom in Judaism that prohibited the destruction of pages of sacred writing. Based on these papers, the book provides abundant testimony about how one large and important medieval Jewish community dealt with the constant presence of poverty in its midst. Building on S. D. Goitein's Mediterranean Society and inspired also by research on poverty and charity in medieval and early modern Europe, it provides a clear window onto the daily lives of the poor. It also illuminates private charity, a subject that has long been elusive to the medieval historian. In addition, Cohen's work functions as a detailed case study of an important phenomenon in human history. Cohen concludes that the relatively narrow gap between the poor and rich, and the precariousness of wealth in general, combined to make charity "one of the major agglutinates of Jewish associational life" during the medieval period.},

  abstract = {Throughout most of the nineteenth century, steamships were the main tool of British informal imperialism in what is now southern Iraq. Despite that centrality, steam shipping on the Tigris was primarily characterized by environmental and political precariousness. This article explores the steamship business of the Lynch Company, which operated on the Tigris beginning in 1861. It examines the political controversies surrounding irrigation and the expansion of the steam fleet as windows on the complex relationship between ecological vulnerability and the practice of empire and diplomacy, arguing that the states of environmental and geopolitical precariousness in which steamships operated reinforced one another, eventually coming to define the British steam enterprise on the Tigris. This precariousness helped make steamships major geopolitical actors, shaping British-Ottoman relations as well as local trade and development policies. The persistence of environmental challenges meant that the Lynch steamships, along with their Ottoman counterparts, simultaneously shaped and were incorporated into local trade and shipping networks, as well as the tribal prestige politics of raiding. On local and international levels, environmental and political issues were intertwined, and steam shipping was crucial to both. The precarious technology that formed the crux of informal imperial intervention on the Tigris is indicative of a kind of empire in which the environment significantly shaped the possibilities of imperial intervention. Precariousness—both environmental and political—came to define technology and empire in late Ottoman Iraq.},

Many Muslim towns in al-Andalus and the Maghrib were famous for textiles woven in local ateliers. During the early middle ages, slaves represented one of the most important exports from Europe to the Muslim world, but sources of northern slaves became limited with the expansion and Christianisation of European territories. More than in the eastern Islamic world, much of the commercial traffic in the Mediterranean involved a combination of maritime and overland travel.},

  abstract = {Moroccan autonomy was threatened from the east by Ottoman expansion into North Africa during the early tenth/sixteenth century. The Ottomans presented a unique challenge in that, as co-religionists, they appealed to Moroccan leaders in the name of Islamic unity and as defenders of the abode of Islam from the Christian Europeans. Moroccan political history during the tenth/sixteenth to twelfth/eighteenth centuries reflects an era in which two dominant sultans, Mawlāy Aḥmad al-Manṣūr and Mawlāy Ismā˓īl were able to create prosperous and relatively successful states, while several other sultans succeeded in maintaining sufficient central authority to sustain functional governments. TheSa˓dī dynasty first arose in the early tenth/sixteenth century, largely in response to Portuguese incursions from their fortresses along the Atlantic coast. Trade agreements signed between Morocco and the European powers were heavily weighted in favour of European interests. The establishment of the Sharīfīan dynasties produced the most durable form of government in the Islamic world.},

  abstract = {State and religion, two of the oldest institutions known to mankind, have historically had a close relationship with each other, but the disestablishment of state religions has been one of the most drastic institutional transformations that has taken place in the modern era. We offer a systematic analysis of the development of secular states based on a political economy approach that is centered on the notion of legitimacy. Viewing religion as a legitimizing force for political leaders, we consider the factors affecting the cost and benefits of alternative sources of legitimacy, such as the differential abilities of religious and secular sources to legitimize political rulers and historical inertia that shaped the cost of monitoring legitimizing agents. To examine this argument empirically, we built a cross-national time-series dataset for the relationship between state and religion since the year 1000. We first use the data to examine the evolution of secularism over time and its variation across religious traditions. We then use regression analysis and an instrumental variables approach to identify the influences on the adoption of secular state, such as concentration in the religion market, religious differences between rulers and the general population, historical inertia of a state, and the prevailing political regime. We address endogeneity concerns regarding the relationship between religious concentration and state secularism by exploiting variation among territories in their geographic distance to religious “capitals” of the world as an instrument.},

Because the Google Ngram data set is not an unbiased sample, and does not include metadata, there are several pitfalls when using it to study language or the popularity of terms. Medical literature accounts for a large, but shifting, share of the corpus, which does not take into account how often the literature is printed, or read.},

It further argues that the Shahnama's aim, content, and execution differed from the histories and poetry produced in the decades immediately preceding and succeeding it, which would account for the lag in its acceptance and popularity. This led later biographers to superimpose their regret over Firdausi' s treatment onto Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, who by their accounts denied him the fame and glory he deserved in his lifetime.]},

Nevertheless, they resemble the sixteenth‐ and seventeenth‐century Cabinets de curiosités in their limited ability to support scholarship or address information needs of defined communities of users.

Humayun's young son Akbar succeeded to the Mughal throne in 963/1556 in his twelfth year. The reign of Akbar's successor Salim or Jahangir, the 'World-seizer', vividly illustrates the importance of idiosyncratic personality and also witnessed the beginnings of Sikhism as a social and political force. Shah Jahan turned his back on Akbar's and Jahangir's sympathetic attitude towards non-Muslims, and he also exhibited little of the relentless intellectual curiosity of Akbar or the deeply emotional artistic sensitivity of Jahangir. One of the earliest signs of Shah Jahan's lofty ambition was the construction of the Peacock Throne, a gem-encrusted monument that was commissioned in 1037/1628 and completed seven years later.},

Using the example of protest discourse in Twitter, in the field of anti-Islamic ‘Pegida’ demonstrations, a three-step method of collecting, reducing and interpreting salient data is proposed. Each step is aligned with opera-tive medial features of the microblog: hashtags, retweets and @-interactions. The exemplary analysis reveals the importance of discussions of attendance numbers in protest discourse and the asymmetry between administrative (i.e. the police) and non-administrative discourse agents. Furthermore, it exemplifies how frequency analysis and sequence analysis can be combined for research in media linguistics.},

The Arab conquests in what would become the Islamic east entailed a number of demographic, social, economic, political and cultural changes that would help determine the parameters for the development of this area. The administration of the fiscal apparatus depended heavily on the same class that had played that role in Sasanian times. Political economy, rather than fiscal administration, provides a better guide to distinguishing the various regions of the Islamic east and following their development. Following al-Mamun's accession to the caliphate and return to Baghdad, the history of the Islamic east becomes primarily that of largely autonomous, hereditary, regional dynasties, namely the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids and Ghaznavids. The Saffarids represented in almost every conceivable way the antithesis of the Tahirid version of regionalism.},

In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65\% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65\% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.},

Contrary to common spelling errors, real-word errors cannot be detected by conventional spelling correction methods. The real-word correction model proposed by Mays, Damerau, and Mercer showed a great performance in different evaluations. In this research, however, a new hybrid approach is proposed which relies on statistical and syntactic knowledge to detect and correct real-word errors. In this model, Constraint Grammar is used to discriminate among sets of correction candidates in the search space. Mays, Damerau, and Mercer’s trigram approach is manipulated to estimate the probability of syntactically well-formed correction candidates. The approach proposed here is tested on the Wall Street Journal corpus. The model can prove to be more practical than some other models, such as WordNet-based method of Hirst and Budanitsky and fixed windows size method of Wilcox-O’Hearn and Hirst.},

  abstract = {"Based on a variety of largely unutilized printed, as well as documentary and manuscript sources collected from archives in the Middle East, North Africa, India and Europe, this dissertation is a longue duree study of the evolution of the conception and function of hadith transmission following the establishment of the hadith canon in the tenth century. It documents how the emergence of the hadith canon plunged Muslim religious scholars in a deep controversy. The establishment of a stable written hadith canon negated the need for the continued oral transmission of hadith. The institution of hadith transmission in the oral/aural mode was, however, integral to the community of hadith scholars' culture and self-image. Hadith scholars saw themselves as the heirs and carriers of a continuous tradition stretching back to the Prophet and the transmission of hadith and the associated chain of transmission was symbolic of this status. On the other hand, scholars, jurists in particular, wanted to be able to harness the authority of the hadith canon as evidence directly without citing a personal chain of transmission. The debates over the value and need of continued oral transmission that erupted in this context are traced revealing how hadith scholars developed an ideology to sustain and give meaning to the chain of transmission in spite of its obsolescence. This ideology asserted that, among other things, the chain of transmission was an essential and unique trait of the Muslim community linking successive generations of Muslims to the Prophet and distinguishing them from the Jews and Christians that preceded them and therefore must be preserved for its own sake, regardless of the fact that the establishment of a stable written hadith corpus had made the original function of the chain of transmission obsolete. It is demonstrated that hadith scholars successfully mobilized this ideology to sustain hadith transmission as an act of piety and further to preserve the chain of transmission as a species of social capital, which scholars could use to establish their position and relative merit within scholarly networks and further which they used in the reproduction of their group identity. This profound shift in the conception of the chain of transmission resulted in a radical reworking of the theory and protocols that had originally been developed to govern the transmission of hadith, as well as the culture and norms of transmission. This new conception of hadith transmission resulted in the emergence of a number of popular and enduring genres of hadith literature, which scholars used as vehicles to express their connection to the Prophet and previous generations of masters through the presentations of chains of transmission. The development of these genres is traced and for the first time their functions are situated in this context of an evolving conception of hadith transmission. The dissertation concludes with an examination of the fate of hadith transmission in the twentieth century following the rise of the various Islamic reform movements and the radical changes to the social and educational institutions of the majority of dar al-Islam."--Pages v-vi.},

The first West Syrian historical texts were produced in the sixth century, when the history of what would become the Syrian Orthodox Church began. An examination of contemporary sources and myths of origins shows that the ethnic origins of the Abgarid dynasty played no part in Syrian \&apos;ethnogenesis\&apos;, but that there existed a notion of Syro-Mesopotamian origins, closely related to a supposed homeland, that of Aram. An acknowledged common ancestry going back to the Chaldean and Assyrian Empires relies on a common language more than a common homeland or sovereign. Whereas the Assyrians came to personify the ever-hostile Persian neighbour, a sort of stereotypical enemy, the Hellenistic kings were perceived as having effected a synthesis of the double Syro-Mesopotamian and Greek culture. The Seleucid era, as adopted by the Edessans, thus remained in use regardless of the prevailing political powers and is an assertion of independence and a strong local identity marker, being a rejection of the local Antiochene as well as the imperial Byzantine eras. The Syrian Orthodox also developed an innovative method of writing the history of their separated Church, producing a new genre consisting of lengthy chronicles written in several parts or columns, in which political and ecclesiastical history were kept separate. This Syrian Orthodox method of writing history is the only truly distinctive Syrian Orthodox literary genre.},

  abstract = {Reading, Writing, and Face Recognition Reading, not to mention writing and texting, is a relatively recent invention, and hence it is believed that a preliterate brain must adapt on the fly, so to speak, in learning how to process written words, rather than being able to rely upon evolutionarily ancient modifications of the visual system pathways. Dehaene et al. (p. 1359, published online 11 November) examined the neural response to a range of visual stimuli in three groups: illiterate adults, adults who learned to read as children, and adults who learned to read as adults. Reading induced a greater facility in processing horizontally oriented stimuli at early stages in the visual pathway and was also associated with the appearance of an area specialized for words. This gain of function appeared to occur at a cost—the area in the temporal cortex devoted to face processing shrank. Does literacy improve brain function? Does it also entail losses? Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain responses to spoken and written language, visual faces, houses, tools, and checkers in adults of variable literacy (10 were illiterate, 22 became literate as adults, and 31 were literate in childhood). As literacy enhanced the left fusiform activation evoked by writing, it induced a small competition with faces at this location, but also broadly enhanced visual responses in fusiform and occipital cortex, extending to area V1. Literacy also enhanced phonological activation to speech in the planum temporale and afforded a top-down activation of orthography from spoken inputs. Most changes occurred even when literacy was acquired in adulthood, emphasizing that both childhood and adult education can profoundly refine cortical organization. Reading changes the mind.

By reviewing studies of illiterate subjects, we propose specific hypotheses on how the functions of core brain systems are partially reoriented or 'recycled' when learning to read. Literacy acquisition improves early visual processing and reorganizes the ventral occipito-temporal pathway: responses to written characters are increased in the left occipito-temporal sulcus, whereas responses to faces shift towards the right hemisphere. Literacy also modifies phonological coding and strengthens the functional and anatomical link between phonemic and graphemic representations. Literacy acquisition therefore provides a remarkable example of how the brain reorganizes to accommodate a novel cultural skill.},

Kuhn described scientists as autonomous agents and an emergent pattern of evolving paradigms. The missing link in his account is then a mechanism by which this pattern self-organizes from the interactions of autonomous scientists without centralized control. This paper exploits advances in agent-based modeling and stigmergy to fill the missing link in Kuhn's account. A complete agent-based model of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions could lead to a better understanding of the contribution of the evolution of the social structure of science to its success.},

  abstract = {Extensive survey of paleocourses of the Ili delta discovered archaeological findings that, chronologically attributed and systematized, allowed the historical reconstruction of the human occupation of the delta. Until recently the colonization was believed to have begun only during medieval times. We argue it began much earlier at the start of the Bronze Age of Kazakhstan (second half of the III millennium BC) under the impulse of new economical activities based on stockbreeding and bronze metallurgy. The basic method of research consisted in surveys, collection of surface finds and documentation of hydrogeological and climatic data. The correlation between the two types of information gives an idea of the factors that influenced the distribution of habitats, mostly represented by winter camps. Their number and concentration change by epoch, pointing to changes in both cultural proclivities and environmental factors. The understanding of the whole historical process requires background knowledge of the hydrological history of the Ili delta, a complex system involving active distributaries and intermittent or inactive paleo-courses, and showing the anticlockwise rotation of 5 successive deltas. Generally speaking, arid climate phases stabilize the delta, pluvial phases favor changes in various directions. Human colonization concerned the two Holocene deltas preceding the modern one: relict terraces of the Uzunaral delta (8–4 ka BP) and terraces of mild active distributaries of the Bakanas delta (4000–250 BP), subject during the last 4000 years to complex geomorphological and hydrological changes that, when reconstructed and correlated with the distribution of finds, explain the location of habitats and allow the mutual chronological attribution of geological and cultural deposits.},

  abstract = {This textbook examines empirical linguistics from a theoretical linguist’s perspective. It provides both a theoretical discussion of what quantitative corpus linguistics entails and detailed, hands-on, step-by-step instructions to implement the techniques in the field. The statistical methodology and R-based coding from this book teach readers the basic and then more advanced skills to work with large data sets in their linguistics research and studies. Massive data sets are now more than ever the basis for work that ranges from usage-based linguistics to the far reaches of applied linguistics. This book presents much of the methodology in a corpus-based approach. However, the corpus-based methods in this book are also essential components of recent developments in sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics. Material from the book will also be appealing to researchers in digital humanities and the many non-linguistic fields that use textual data analysis and text-based sensorimetrics. Chapters cover topics including corpus processing, frequencing data, and clustering methods. Case studies illustrate each chapter with accompanying data sets, R code, and exercises for use by readers. This book may be used in advanced undergraduate courses, graduate courses, and self-study.},

  abstract = {Desktop publishing (DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal ("desktop") computer. It was first used almost exclusively for print publications, but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content, from menus to magazines to books, without the expense of commercial printing.Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution — although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays, presentations, infographics, brochures, business cards, promotional items, trade show exhibits, retail package designs and outdoor signs. Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP isn't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media. The job descriptions that include "DTP," such as DTP artist, often require skills using software for producing e-books, web content, and web pages, which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface.},

These scholars have, however, given little attention to the role of periodization. By contrast, this study suggests that periodization has been a central element of historiography in the monarchies. Many textbooks and other major works in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Jordan, and Morocco follow two broad tendencies in terms of periodization. The first tendency is to merge dynastic and national periods and to start the history of the country essentially with the rise of the contemporary ruling family. The second tendency is to integrate the contemporary dynasty into the history of a longer, sometimes perennial, monarchy. Nevertheless, official dynastic periodization has not determined all historical writing in the monarchies. Local and tribal historians often developed periodizations centered on specific cities or tribes and also imagined a much longer history than that of the contemporary dynasty.},

Reflecting communal adaptations of the Sufi dhikr, or “remembrance” of God, as part of healing or funerary ceremonies, these rites were reclassified, in Soviet ethnographic literature, as vestiges of “shamanism,” and thus largely escaped notice by western observers of “Soviet Islam,” who imagined ‘Sufism’ in terms of clandestine militant organizations intent on undermining the Soviet regime. This paper explores the reclassification of Sufi activity as shamanism, notes historical evidence on the diffusion of Sufi rites into wider public circles, and suggests some implications of these developments for our understanding of Soviet Islam, Central Asian Sufism, and the phenomena of “shamanism.”},

The book has a wide-ranging chronological and geographic scope, from early Neolithic to late Iron Age and from Western Europe to East Asia. It includes world-renowned sites and artefact collections such as the Tollense Valley Bronze Age battlefield (Germany), the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Tanum (Sweden), and the British Museum collection of bronze weaponry from the late Shang period (China). Original case studies are presented in each section by a diverse international authorship.The study of warfare and violence in prehistoric and pre-literate societies has been at the forefront of archaeological debate since the publication of Keeley’s provocative monograph ‘War Before Civilization’ (Oxford 1996). The problem has been approached from a number of standpoints including anthropological and behavioural studies of interpersonal violence, osteological examinations of sharp lesions and blunt-force traumas, wear analysis of ancient weaponry, and field experiments with replica weapons and armour. This research, however, is often confined within the boundaries of the various disciplines and specialist fields. In particular, a gap can often be detected between the research approaches grounded in the humanities and social sciences and those based on the archaeological sciences. The consequence is that, to this day, the subject is dominated by a number of undemonstrated assumptions regarding the nature of warfare, combat, and violence in non-literate societies. Moreover, important methodological questions remain unanswered: can we securely distinguish between violence-related and accidental trauma on skeletal remains? To what extent can wear analysis shed light on long-forgotten fighting styles? Can we design meaningful combat tests based on historic martial arts? And can the study of rock-art unlock the social realities of prehistoric warfare? By breaking the mould of entrenched subject boundaries, this edited volume promotes interdisciplinary debate in the study of prehistoric warfare and violence by presenting a number of innovative approaches that integrate qualitative and quantitative methods of research and analysis.},

D. 541. Based primarily on the Arabic plague treatises written after the Black Death (the second plague pandemic in the mid-fourteenth century), the history of the plague epidemics through the Umaiyad Period has been reconstructed. These epidemics provoked medical and religio-legal explanations and prescriptions, which have strongly influenced the attitudes and behavior of the Muslim community toward the disease. Besides the deaths of important men by plague, it is suggested that the endemic nature of plague during the early Islamic Empire may have significantly retarded population growth and debilitated Muslim society in Syria and Iraq during the Umaiyad Period.},

Scholars of early Islamic history have shown increased interest in developing new approaches and methods, and in looking at such things as social history, gender relations, identity formation and economic history. Beyond the thorny problems posed by the heritage of the polemical tradition and by the deficiencies of the sources for early Islamic history, there exist other problems of perception and conceptualisation, as well as practical obstacles, that have affected Western approaches to early Islamic history.},

It discusses different notions of periodization, in particular those advanced by Fernand Braudel and others of the Annales School and the concept of “Zeitschichten” proposed by Reinhart Koselleck. It surveys some of the periodizations that have traditionally been applied specifically in the realm of the history of the Islamic Near East and a number of essays discussing the periodization of Islamic history (especially those of S. D. Goitein and M. Morony). It argues that the notion of an “ideal” or “perfect” periodization of history (or of any subsection of it) that meets all needs is futile. Periodization must be seen, rather, as a tool employed by the historian that highlights a particular set of developments in a society, so that many different periodizations are possible and, indeed, desirable depending on what the historian wishes to understand. The historian must consider what development she wishes to articulate from the past and choose or fashion a periodization that most clearly illuminates that development.},

The essays and discussion topics were posted on a WordPress platform with a special plug-in that allowed readers to add paragraph-level comments in the margins, transforming the work into socially networked texts. This first installment drew an enthusiastic audience, over 50 comments on the texts, and over 1,000 unique visitors to the site from across the globe, with many who stayed on the site for a significant period of time to read the work. To facilitate this new volume, Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access platform to capture reader comments on drafts and shape the book as it developed. Following a period of open peer review and discussion, the finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) how digital and emergent technologies have changed the ways that historians think, teach, author, and publish"--},

After establishing when, where, and, most importantly, why good riding began, Drews goes on to show how riding raiders terrorized the civilized world in the seventh century BC, and how central cavalry was to the success of the Median and Persian empires." "Drawing on archaeological, iconographic, and textual evidence, this is the first book devoted to the question of when horseback riders became important in combat.

Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editions--and the theories that underpin them. The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind. Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation of the discipline--one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and printed works from across literary history, and the globe. The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing, along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting point for further scholarship.

  abstract = {Purpose A Recent work in information studies re-engages with theories of subject enunciation first developed in the work of twentieth century structuralist and post-structuralist critics. To date this work has not been extended to the analysis of data visualizations. The purpose of this paper is to assert that information visualizations embody specific dynamics of positionality for which linguist Emile Benveniste’s formulation of a speaking and spoken subject provides a critical analytic framework. In particular, enunciative theory can be used to explicitly address the mechanisms of power formation in information graphics “spreadsheets, charts and interfaces” that are frequently seen as mere presentations of quantitative or statistical information. This approach is based on attention to the performative aspects of graphic expression and the ways familiar features such as frontality framing and scale can be read critically. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical argument that applies literature in enunciation as developed in linguistics, film theory, and psychoanalysis to information visualizations. The paper makes specific analyses of the graphical features of spreadsheets, common charts and graphs, and interfaces to show how they create speaking and spoken subject positions. Findings The theory of enunciation is useful in understanding the ways information representations, particularly visualizations of data, work to produce power relations. Research limitations/implications The topic may seem to draw on theoretical positions that are associated with structural and post-structural theory popular three decades ago, but since the study of enunciation was never applied to information visualizations, the work feels timely. Recent work in information studies has re-engaged with these theoretical issues, but not applied them to charts, graphs, and other visual forms.

  abstract = {[19-21, 2010-05] The Quranic Arabic Corpus (http://corpus.quran.com) is an annotated linguistic resource with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar. The motivation behind this work is to produce a resource that enables further analysis of the Quran, the 1,400 year old central religious text of Islam. This paper describes a new approach to morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic, a genre difficult to compare with other forms of Arabic. Processing Quranic Arabic is a unique challenge from a computational point of view, since the vocabulary and spelling differ from Modern Standard Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus differs from other Arabic computational resources in adopting a tagset that closely follows traditional Arabic grammar. We made this decision in order to leverage a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, and to encourage online collaborative annotation. In this paper, we discuss how the unique challenge of morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic is solved using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic morphological tagging using diacritic edit-distance, two-pass manual verification, and online collaborative annotation. This process is evaluated to validate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology.},

  abstract = {Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of successful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic. Classical Arabic has been studied in depth by grammarians for over a thousand years using a traditional grammar known as i’rāb (إعغاة ). Using this grammar to develop a representation for parsing is challenging, as it describes syntax using a hybrid of phrase-structure and dependency relations. This work aims to advance the state-of-the-art for hybrid parsing by introducing a formal representation for annotation and a resource for machine learning. The main contributions are the first treebank for Classical Arabic and the first statistical dependency-based parser in any language for ellipsis, dropped pronouns and hybrid representations. A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an 87.47\% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an F1-score of 89.03\%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is better suited to Classical Arabic. The Quran was chosen for annotation as a large body of work exists providing detailed syntactic analysis. Volunteer crowdsourcing is used for annotation in combination with expert supervision. A practical result of the annotation effort is the corpus website: http://corpus.quran.com, an educational resource with over two million users per year.},

The first task outperforms Burrows’ Delta by a wide margin on short texts and a small margin on long texts. The second task has no such benchmark with existing methods. The data set for evaluating the method consists of speeches from the US House and Senate from 1995 to 2013. This data set contains both a large number of texts (42,000 in the test sets) and a large number of speakers (over 800). The article shows that this approach to authorship analysis is more accurate than existing approaches given a data set with hundreds of authors. Further, this profile-based method makes new types of analysis possible by looking at types of individuals as well as at specific individuals.},

These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected"--Provided by publisher.},

In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin. There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love.},

Although intuition suggests picking the most typical texts (whatever ‘typical’ means) by the authors studied, any arbitrary choice might substantially affect the final results. Thus, to eschew cherry picking, we introduce a method of verification of the choice of ‘typical’ samples, inspired by k-fold cross-validation procedures. Namely, we use a bootstrap-like approach to choose randomly, in 500 iterations, the samples for the training and the test sets. Next, we examine the obtained 500 attribution accuracy scores: if the density function shows widespread results, the corpus is assumed to be very sensitive to the permutations of the training set. To test this methodology empirically, we have selected roughly similar corpora in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Polish. The results show considerable resistance of the English corpus to permutations, while the other corpora turned out to be more dependent on the choice of the samples; the Polish corpus produces both accuracy and consistency below any acceptable standards.},

A few controlled tests for different sample lengths, languages, and genres are discussed and compared. Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method (Burrows, J.F. (2002). ‘Delta’: a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 17(3): 267–87) applied to the most frequent words, some additional experiments have been conducted for support vector machines and k-NN applied to most frequent words, character 3-grams, character 4-grams, and parts-of-speech-tag 3-grams. Despite significant differences in overall attributive success rate between particular methods and/or style markers, the minimal amount of textual data needed for reliable authorship attribution turned out to be method-independent.},

Relying on contaminated data is similar to using dirty test tubes in a laboratory: it inescapably means falling into systematic error. An important question is what degree of nonchalance is acceptable to obtain sufficiently reliable results. The present study attempts to verify the impact of unwanted noise in a series of experiments conducted on several corpora of English, German, Polish, Ancient Greek, and Latin prose texts. In 100 iterations, a given corpus was gradually damaged, and controlled tests for authorship were applied. The first experiment was designed to show the correlation between a dirty corpus and attribution accuracy. The second was aimed to test how disorder in word frequencies—produced by scribal and/or editorial modifications—affects the attribution abilities of particular corpora. The goal of the third experiment was to test how much ‘authorial’ data a given text needs to have to trace authorial fingerprint through a mass of external quotations.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a new stylometric method that combines supervised machine-learning classification with the idea of sequential analysis. Unlike standard procedures, aimed at assessing style differentiation between discrete text samples, the new method, supported with compact visualization, tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Three flavors of the method have been introduced: (1) Rolling SVM, relying on the support vector machines (SVM) classifier, (2) Rolling NSC, based on the nearest shrunken centroids method, and (3) Rolling Delta, using the classic Burrowsian measure of similarity. The technique is primarily intended to assess mixed authorship; however, it can be also used as a magnifying glass to inspect works with unclear stylometric signal. To demonstrate its applicability, three different examples of collaborative work have been briefly discussed: (1) the 13th-century French allegorical poem Roman de la Rose , (2) a 15th-century translation of the Bible into Polish known as Queen Sophia’s Bible , and (3) The Inheritors , a novel collaboratively written by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford in 1901.},

A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular ‘snapshots’, or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets.},

In these networks, nodes are function words and directed edges between two nodes represent the relative frequency of directed co-appearance of the two words. For every analyzed play, a WAN is constructed and these are aggregated to generate author profile networks. We first study the similarity of writing styles between Early English playwrights by comparing the profile WANs. The accuracy of using WANs for authorship attribution is then demonstrated by attributing known plays among six popular playwrights. Moreover, the WAN method is shown to outperform other frequency-based methods on attributing Early English plays. In addition, WANs are shown to be reliable classifiers even when attributing collaborative plays. For several plays of disputed co-authorship, a deeper analysis is performed by attributing every act and scene separately, in which we both corroborate existing breakdowns and provide evidence of new assignments.},

Aʿyan and Zuhayr b. al-Musayyab b. Zuhayr; d) The armies of al-Ḥasan b. Sahl in al-ʿIrāq from 198 or 199/813-814, which at the beginning mainly consisted of the armies of Harthama and Zuhayr b. al-Musayyab, the Abnāwīs; e) The stiff opposition to al-Maʾmūn and to al-Faḍl b. Sahl in Khurāsān. A notable opposition to al-Maʾmūn and al-Faḍl b. Sahl was that of Harthama b. Aʿyan and another senior Abnāwī. It seems that the main reason for this opposition, which eventually ended in Harthama's execution in Marw, was his opposition to the murder of al-Amīn that was carried out with the agreement and approval of al-Maʾmūn. Close study of the evidence on the senior commanders who were sent by al-Maʾmūn from Marw to al-ʿIrāq (between 200-203/815-818) reveals that most of them were in fact Arabs, or belonged to veteran families of the Abnāʾ. Only rare information is given about the ethnic nature of their contingents; there is no evidence of non-Arab commanders or troops sent from Marw.},

It is difficult to discern the character of the Shākiriyya in the service of the Arab commanders in Central Asia from the Arabic sources. They provide no information on ethnic composition, mobilization, military training or potential ties between a commander/master and his Shākir. This applies mainly to the Umawī period, but also to the first ʿAbbāsī period up to al-Maʾ- mūn’s rule (813-833). It is also impossible to determine from them the possible connections between the ancient Central Asian military institutions and military institutions in the Islamic world. From evidence about the Shākiriyya in the Arabic sources we can usually discern a distinct military character, though it is noteworthy that in some cases the term Shākirī can be translated as meaning a loyal adherent, or even a servant.While relatively extensive, the evidence at hand from the Umawī and the early ʿAbbāsī periods is too limited to fully demonstrate that a) the Shākiriyya units denote Turks and b) that these allegedly Turkish units performed their service for the ʿAbbāsī caliphs according to concepts and practices derived from the Central Asian steppe.},

Iraq was the wealthiest province of the empire, and had been undergoing a process of agricultural development since the Umayyad period. Al-Mahdi's decade-long reign was by all accounts a prosperous time for the caliphate. When the Abbasid succession passed on to Harun al-Rashid, it was finally the anticipated moment which different factions wanted. After achieving reconciliation with the Abbasid family and granting amnesty to former opponents in Baghdad, al-Mamun dispatched Abd Allah ibn Tahir on the mission of reunification. Just as al-Mamun's political achievements radically transformed the Abbasid government, his religious policies were equally new and daring.},

This article demonstrates the adaption of WGCNA to mine an entire genre of literature, describing its dominant features, exposing its evolution through time, and dissecting its plot structures. WGCNA not only finds these large-scale structures, but exposes the fine-grained contribution of individual words. Romance accounts for 16.7\% of all novels sold in the USA, and is the most popular form of genre literature (Romance Writers of America, 2013; Industry Statistics. http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=580 (accessed 13 June 2013)). Selling into 111 different markets and thirty-one languages, Harlequin is the largest publisher of romance worldwide, and its most successful category line, Harlequin Presents, offers the reader ‘pure romantic fantasy’ (Harlequin Presents Writing Guidelines)—romance in an almost archetypal sense. Despite the popularity, ubiquity and profitability of category romance, there is relatively little study to date on the phenomenon. Using WGCNA together with all electronically available Harlequin Presents novels—some 1,400 from 1999 to 2013—this article demonstrates that the genre’s fundamental architecture is a choir of authorial voices, that its evolution is dominated by sudden shifts due to financial pressures on the publisher, and that the order in which elements appear—the plot—is largely fixed.},

  abstract = {The story of how Arab editors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries revolutionized Islamic literatureIslamic book culture dates back to late antiquity, when Muslim scholars began to write down their doctrines on parchment, papyrus, and paper and then to compose increasingly elaborate analyses of, and commentaries on, these ideas. Movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century, and it wasn't until the second half of the century that the first works of classical Islamic religious scholarship were printed there. But from that moment on, Ahmed El Shamsy reveals, the technology of print transformed Islamic scholarship and Arabic literature.In the first wide-ranging account of the effects of print and the publishing industry on Islamic scholarship, El Shamsy tells the fascinating story of how a small group of editors and intellectuals brought forgotten works of Islamic literature into print and defined what became the classical canon of Islamic thought. Through the lens of the literary culture of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Arab cities—especially Cairo, a hot spot of the nascent publishing business—he explores the contributions of these individuals, who included some of the most important thinkers of the time. Through their efforts to find and publish classical literature, El Shamsy shows, many nearly lost works were recovered, disseminated, and harnessed for agendas of linguistic, ethical, and religious reform.Bringing to light the agents and events of the Islamic print revolution, Rediscovering the Islamic Classics is an absorbing examination of the central role printing and its advocates played in the intellectual history of the modern Arab world.},

It consisted of certain items: some real estate, but primarily jewelry and domestic goods.

Women ruled, with more or less variety and fantasy, the furniture of the house which was used not only for rest and sleep, but also as a venue for receiving guests. /// 449 inventaires après décès damascènes, vers 1700, aident à aborder un sujet qui s'inscrit dans les gender studies, en permettant la comparaison entre le monde féminin et le monde masculin, dans le domaine économique, social, voire culturel.

We have first to identify the appropriate type of model for the system under consideration and then to tailor it to the specifics of the case. To understand settlement formation, which is the concern of this paper, this not only involves choosing input parameter values such as site separations but also input functions which characterises the ease of travel between sites. Although the generic behaviour of the model is understood, the details are not. Different choices will necessarily lead to different outputs (for identical inputs). We can only proceed if choices that are `close' give outcomes that are similar. Where there are local differences it suggests that there was no compelling reason for one outcome rather than the other. If these differences are important for the historic record we may interpret this as sensitivity to contingency. We re-examine the rise of Greek city-states as first formulated by Rihll and Wilson in 1979, initially using the same `retail' gravity model. We suggest that, whereas cities like Athens owe their position to a combination of geography and proximity to other sites, the rise of Thebes is the most contingent, whose success reflects social forces outside the grasp of simple network modelling.},

Findings are connected to the discussion in institutional economics and economic history concerning the importance of institutional developments in long-distance trade for economic growth in medieval Europe, the efficiency of self-enforcing institutions, and the divergence of institutional arrangements in medieval maritime trade. Finally, both potentials and limitations of agent-based models for historical research are discussed.},

The break with the still widespread positivistic concept of Quellenforschung is overdue since its value for the understanding of literary works is questionable. The interpretation of any work of literature, which includes historiography, has to start with the analysis of the structures of the work in its transmitted form. A biographical work, such as ibn Khallikan's Wafayat al-A'yan, is composed of individual biographies, which can be broken down into smaller units: strictly biographical parts and narrative units (anecdotes and aphorisms). A literary critic trying to understand and explain the biographical work must begin with the analysis of these small narrative units, and from there proceed to the work as a whole, and only then to its place in history.},

Drawing on the abundant historical literature, many recent studies have examined the social impacts of climate change in China during the past 2000 years. This paper reviews the main progress of these studies in three parts. First, a concept model based on the food security in relation to global climate change has been constructed, which can then be used to interpret impact-response processes of climate change in the history of China. Second, we derive a methodology for quantifying the impact of historical climate change, drawing on a series of 4 key social and economic sequences at a 10-year resolution. These have been reconstructed based on the semantic differential method over the past 2000 years in China. Third, using a variety of statistical analyses, we update the understanding of climate impacts throughout the history of China. The overall impacts of climate were negative in the cold periods and positive in the warm periods, at decadal to centennial scales during Chinese history. However, the impacts seemed a mixed blessing both in the cold or warm periods. The social-economic development and population growth in warm periods would intensify the natural resource shortage and disequilibria in the human-environment system, especially when encountering abrupt climate changes. Adaptation to adverse climate change could not only help people to avoid hardship whilst maximizing profits, but also expanded the capabilities for the continual development of Chinese civilization.},

In replacing social history as the dominant new prospective on the past, cultural historians tried to address some of the serious questions raised about the methods of social historians while they adopted the new subjects that social historians had brought into the field. In their revised strategies, cultural historians brought back into awareness issues relating to the contingent, the personal, and the eccentric. At the same time, in swinging away from the vigorous research methods and forms of disciplined inquiry that had become the hallmarks of social historians, cultural historians frequently fell into a variety of problems that have now become quite visible in the field. By urging that the close alliance between cultural and social history be refreshed, Paula Fass suggests ways in which contemporary cultural historians can strengthen their research and writing by learning from the methods and strategies of social history.},

There were two different periods in the history of Farghana under the Samanids. During the first period (till 916), Farghana was an independent, hereditary dominion ruled by the Farghanan branch of the Samanids. It was founded by Aḥmad b. Asad. His sons (Asad, Isḥāq) and grandsons (Nūḥ, Aḥmad and Muḥammad, sons of Asad, and Muḥammad, son of Isḥāq) also ruled Farghana (or part of it). The Samanids in Farghana minted as independent rulers and only the sixth of them, Muḥammad b. Asad, mentioned the head of the dynasty on his coins (in 915-16). The Samanids of Farghana several times rebelled against the central government. During the second period (924-91), Farghana was a province of the Samanid state, where governors of non-Samanid origin ruled the towns (or all of Farghana), granted to them by the Samanid Amīrs as appanages for their service. Most of these governors were Turkish generals who rose to power from the rank and file of the ghulāms (slave soldiers) of the Palace Guard in the capital.},

The chapter focuses on the ways in which developments in local intellectual and cultural histories between 1500 and 1800 reflect localisations of Islam in the region as well as the engaged involvement of South-East Asian Muslims within a global, cosmopolitan community of Islamic religious scholarship. Over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a distinct style of regional Islamicate culture developed on the north Java coast (pesisir) in which elements from the traditions of Muslim South Asia and the Middle East, as well as from China and diverse areas of the Indonesian archipelago were combined with local traditions.},

Using Chinese historical literature as well as stone inscriptions, a total of five historical saline lake bodies which had existed in this region were documented: Lakes Yanchize, Xiluchi, Dongluchi, Zhuyanze and Xiaoyanchi. Lakes Zhuyanze, Yanchize, Xiluchi, Dongluchi, and Xiaoyanchi desiccated respectively at some point during 1076–1701 AD, 1584–1735 AD, 1666–1791 AD, 1666–1791 AD, and 1712–1906 AD. The lakes in the west of this region possibly desiccated relatively early, and the lakes in the east desiccated relatively late. Most of the lakes desiccated during a cold climate period. It seems that the dry period of the 15th–17th centuries overlapped with the periods that some of the lakes desiccated. All the five lakes desiccated during periods of increased soil erosion. The main causes of the degradation and desiccation of Lakes Yanchize, Xiluchi and Dongluchi were flood irrigation and silt sedimentation. The degradation and desiccation of Lake Yanchize and Lakes Dongluchi and Xiluchi corresponded to periods of population explosion when land was heavily cultivated in Fuping and Pucheng Counties. The existence of historical saline lakes indicates that the remains of the Sanmen Paleo-Lake existed in the Guanzhong Basin during the past 2000 years.},

The model provides an innovative approach to establishing the optimal distribution of cognitive labor in scientific communities, using an epistemic landscape. In the paper, we provide a critical examination of ELM. First, we show that the computing mechanism for ELM is correct insofar as we are able to replicate the results using another programming language. Second, we show that small changes in the rules that determine the behavior of individual agents can lead to important changes in simulation results. Accordingly, we claim that ELM results are robust with respect to the computing mechanism, but not necessarily across parameter space. We conclude by reflecting on the possible lessons to be gained from ELM as a class of simulations or cluster of models.},

Venetians applied the notion of sexual innocence to both children and adolescents well before the eighteenth century. Through an analysis of criminal investigations from the repositories of the Executors of the Bestemmia and the Council of Forty during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, the essay illustrates the ways in which Venetian authorities, parish priests, and members of the city's neighborhood communities attempted to shelter youth from exposure to adult sexual behavior. Within the spheres of public and clandestine prostitution, the intimacy of the domestic hearth, and the neighborhood streets, judicial authorities, relying on the testimonies of eye witnesses, removed youth in danger from their homes and places of work, punishing prostitutes, exploitative parents, and sexual predators. While formal laws defined minority and majority age and cognizance of right and wrong in gendered terms, ordinary Venetians were more casual about age than legal theorists and expressed a strong aversion toward the sexual perils surrounding youth of both sexes from their childhood years to well into their teens.},

Taking data from Czech, an inflected language, in which the most optimal conditions to respond to this research question are met, the book expands the understanding of language and text in ways that have not been executed before. For predominantly English-based quantitative research, this volume fills a crucial gap by examining the relationship between inflection and other phenomena (including discourse, translation and literature). For the current qualitative research, the volume provides large empirical data to confirm some of its claims, but more importantly, it demonstrates the important role of detailed grammatical concepts that have not been considered before. Besides addressing fundamental questions about text analysis methods, the volume presents a diverse array of Czech data that are unique in their own right and worthy of dissemination to the general audience. Taming the Corpus: From Inflection and Lexis to Interpretation is divided into three sections. Section 1 deals with phonotactics, poetic structure, morphological complexity used to differentiate literary style, and native speakers’ sense of grammaticality – issues pertinent to linguistic typology, cognition and language, and literary studies. Section 2 focuses on inter-language relations, especially the theory of translation. Section 3 demonstrates how quantitative analysis of texts can contribute to our understanding of society and connects the volume to legal language, construction of gender and discourse position and implicit ideology.},

Ibn Tūmart's movement can be understood within its Berber context, in which a charismatic figure with a religious message provided the glue by which tribes were united in a common enterprise leading to state formation. As for al-Andalus, Almoravid rule had been seriously weakened as a result of Christian expansion and of the concentration on fighting the Almohads in the Maghrib.

  abstract = {What do the geographical areas included in this volume have in common over a period reaching from the fifth/eleventh to the twelfth/eighteenth century that would give meaning to both the periodisation and the geographical subdivisions used here? As noted in their introduction by the editors of volume 3 of the New Cambridge history of Islam (The eastern Islamic world, fifth/eleventh to twelfth/eighteenth centuries), a certain degree of arbitrariness always accompanies the need to make temporal and territorial divisions. The obvious Mediterranean articulation of the political and commercial trends dealt with in this volume should not obscure the deep connections that linked the western and eastern Islamic worlds – their populations, their religious and political concepts and practices, and their economies. It is also obvious that the encounter, not to say clash, with the two great civilisations of India and China mostly affected the eastern regions of the Islamic world, while the encounter and clash with Christendom had a deeper impact on the western Islamic regions. But here again things were not as simple as may appear. The westward diffusion of tea from China can be used to exemplify the often convoluted paths through which links between different areas were established. Having been used in the Chinese empire for centuries, tea was not introduced into Iran until the eleventh/seventeenth century; yet it was not from there that it crossed into the Ottoman lands.},

This corpus, which I call the ‘ProppLearner’ corpus, was assembled to provide data for an algorithm designed to learn Vladimir Propp’s morphology of Russian hero tales. The corpus is the most deeply annotated narrative corpus available at this time. The algorithm and learning results are described elsewhere; here, I provide detail on the layers of annotation and how they were chosen, novel layers of annotation required for successful learning, the selection of the texts for annotation, the annotation process itself, and the resulting inter-annotator agreement measures. In particular, the corpus comprised fifteen texts totaling 18,862 words. There were eighteen layers of annotation, five of which were developed specifically to support learning Propp’s morphology: referent attributes, context relationships, event valences, Propp’s ‘dramatis personae’, and Propp’s functions. All annotations were created by trained annotators with the Story Workbench annotation tool, following a double-annotation paradigm. I discuss lessons learned from this effort and what they mean for future digital humanities efforts when working with the semantics of natural language text.},

We offer an empirical, encyclopaedic approach to historical semantics regarding ‘conceptual history’, i.e. the history of concepts that shape thought, culture and society in a particular period. We relate the project to traditional work in conceptual and semantic history and define our object of study as the discursive concept, a category of meaning encoded linguistically as a cluster of expressions that co-occur in discourse. We describe our principal data source, EEBO-TCP, and introduce our key research interests, namely, the contexts of conceptual change, the semantic structure of lexical fields and the nature of lexicalisation pressure. We outline our computational processes, which build upon the theoretical definition of discursive concepts, to discover the linguistically encoded forms underpinning the discursive concepts we seek to identify in EEBO-TCP. Finally, we share preliminary results via a worked example, exploring the discursive contexts in which paradigmatic terms of key cultural concepts emerge. We consider the extent to which particular genres, discourses and users in the early modern period make paradigms, and examine the extent to which these contexts determine the characteristics of key concepts.},

Recent trends in digital research tools and methods have tended to deemphasize the quantitative and objective character of textual study, and instead have focused on an understanding of the digital text as an intellectual model, and digital tools as ways of exploring and interpreting that model. This is true both for textual analysis tools, which have adopted a rhetoric of interpretive richness and open-ended play, and for digital editing, in which readerly enablement and editorial interpretation are at the forefront. In both domains, though, there are internal tensions: for textual analysis, the question of how the text is constituted and how far we are willing to relinquish evidentiary claims; for digital editing, the question of how to accommodate a rhetoric of “fidelity” and “accuracy” to the goals of interpretive power and readerly choice.},

The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context.

The Ottomans also advanced southwards, raiding in Epiros and Albania. In the Peloponnese, the Ottomans advanced successfully under the Ottoman commander Evrenos.

The Ottoman army had become an efficient fighting machine, able to lay siege effectively and to defeat the enemy in formal battles.

We have found that Doha in its urban layout, physical development, architecture, and pre-oil demographics, combined its disparate cosmopolitan elements into a blend that probably typified the historic Gulf town, simultaneously encapsulating aspects of the generalised “Arab and Islamic town.” We have found strong structural principles at work in both the traditional and the early modern town, many of which correlate strongly with tribal social organisation, although the historic population of Doha was neither overwhelmingly tribal in character nor entirely Arab in origin. Rather, these constituted prevailing ideologies, social structures, and identities in a diverse and cosmopolitan population},

It offers comparative evidence from eastern Iran to support the suggestion that this was a funerary monument built for a Ghūrid patron in the late twelfth century and discusses the tomb in relation to other extant Ghūrid structures in South Asia. It emphasizes the degree of regional continuity in Ghūrid architecture by highlighting aspects of the building's design that are also present in the pre-Ghūrid Buddhist and Hindu architecture of the Indus Valley but absent in the medieval monuments of eastern Iran or western India. Accounting for the transculturation to which the tomb bears witness, the author draws attention to the mutual receptivity of eastern Iranian and South Asian architecture in the late twelfth century.},

  abstract = {Universities around the world have increasingly turned to digital infrastructures as a way to revamp the arts and humanities. This article contributes a fresh understanding by examining the material development of HumlabX, a research laboratory for digital humanities at Umeå University, Sweden. Specifically, we approach the empirical case as a timeline of research funding, projects, events, and deliverables to examine how the research laboratory as an organizational and material space developed and evolved in relation to new technology investments. Based on our analysis, we argue that while digital research infrastructures can, indeed, stimulate innovation in and around research, aimed to produce new knowledge, digital technologies carry social and material implications that affect organizational processes. We show that while knowledge production processes at HumlabX were highly influenced by the infrastructural legacy of the past, they indeed directed scholars toward innovation. By discussing these implications in detail, we move beyond the debate of humanities qua digital, and demonstrate the need for scholars of digital humanities to engage in the development of policies for digital research infrastructures. Using a Swedish case study, we argue that research laboratories for the digital humanities must be scrutinized and should be fully exposed as socio-material organizations that develop, and should develop, over time. In particular, we stress the need to ensure that digital humanities laboratories are sustainable and open for redevelopment.},

International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms: Image, Object, Text offers a unique contribution to the field of periodical studies, while also broadening the scope of purview to consider related content with regards to other relevant printed matter and cultural products, as well as digital archiving strategies. Including interdisciplinary contributions from academics around the world, the volume presents a wide range of approaches to periodicals and printed matter from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Questions of material print culture and the digital realm are considered both via theoretical and more empirical approaches. As a whole, the book considers the pluralism of perspectives that the study of periodicals and printed matter contribute to our historical understanding of various political and social issues, and also devotes attention to the ways in which digital archiving projects can be instrumentalized as a strategy for filling in gaps in the historical record. International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms should be of great interest to researchers, academics and postgraduates engaged in the study of periodicals, publishing, book history, world literature, digital humanities, media, visual and material culture},

This article describes an approach for detecting the sorts of intertexts that literary scholars have found most meaningful, as embodied in the free Tesserae website http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/. Tests of Tesserae Versions 1 and 2 showed that word-level n-gram matching could recall a majority of parallels identified by scholarly commentators in a benchmark set. But these versions lacked precision, so that the meaningful parallels could be found only among long lists of those that were not meaningful. The Version 3 search described here adds a second stage scoring system that sorts the found parallels by a formula accounting for word frequency and phrase density. Testing against a benchmark set of intertexts in Latin epic poetry shows that the scoring system overall succeeds in ranking parallels of greater significance more highly, allowing site users to find meaningful parallels more quickly. Users can also choose to adjust both recall and precision by focusing only on results above given score levels. As a theoretical matter, these tests establish that lemma identity, word frequency, and phrase density are important constituents of what make a phrase parallel a meaningful intertext.},

  abstract = {\mbox\mbox This volume debuts the new scope of Remote Sensing, which was first defined as the analysis of data collected by sensors that were not in physical contact with the objects under investigation (using cameras, scanners, and radar systems operating from spaceborne or airborne platforms). A wider characterization is now possible: Remote Sensing can be any non-destructive approach to viewing the buried and nominally invisible evidence of past activity. Spaceborne and airborne sensors, now supplemented by laser scanning, are united using ground-based geophysical instruments and undersea remote sensing, as well as other non-invasive techniques such as surface collection or field-walking survey. Now, any method that enables observation of evidence on or beneath the surface of the earth, without impact on the surviving stratigraphy, is legitimately within the realm of Remote Sensing. \mbox The new interfaces and senses engaged in Remote Sensing appear throughout the book. On a philosophical level, this is about the landscapes and built environments that reveal history through place and time. It is about new perspectives—the views of history possible with Remote Sensing and fostered in part by immersive, interactive 3D and 4D environments discussed in this volume. These perspectives are both the result and the implementation of technological, cultural, and epistemological advances in record keeping, interpretation, and conceptualization. Methodology presented here builds on the current ease and speed in collecting data sets on the scale of the object, site, locality, and landscape. As this volume shows, many disciplines surrounding archaeology and related cultural studies are currently involved in Remote Sensing, and its relevance will only increase as the methodology expands.},

By dispossessing his enemies-who were depicted as the arch-enemies of Sunni Islam-Saladin succeeded in collecting estates, farm land, houses and buildings that in the past were owned by the Fatimids, Armenians and Franks. This property was endowed by him to support the new Islamic institutions he founded in Cairo and Jerusalem.},

The tax burden for an average Muslim was an alms-tax of about 2-10 per cent of his revenue, and another tax levied on his land, which could be either the tithe of the revenue off his Muslim land, or the land-tax levied on newly occupied land. Even though many aspects of early Islamic taxation are subject to debate, there is no doubt about who eventually used up most of the levied tax: the military. Large-scale use of Turkish slave soldiers restricted the Arabs' influence to the civil sector, which was a considerable price to pay. In Egypt the combination of military slavery and iqṭā reached its peak after the ascension of the Mamlūk dynasty. The Ottoman empire had emerged out of the bankrupt Saljuq empire in western Anatolia at the end of the seventh/thirteenth century.},

The application of software to assist in the analysis of large collections of data does not just expand the volume of material we can incorporate in our work, it also expands how we in the humanities understand the nature of meaning. The recent scholarly turn to the expanded modes of analysis made possible by DH is not just the “latest new thing” but gives the scholarly community a way to articulate and respond to long-standing doubts about the epistemological grounding in the practice of the humanities. Even more importantly, I believe that this broadening of inquiry afforded by DH is intrinsic to the humanistic project itself. In this essay, I seek in particular to connect the implicit conceptual substructure behind the architectural logic of the digital humanities to key strains of hermeneutic thought that have established a basis for exploring the question of how we are to understand the vast, variegated world of historical human experience that is the object of our humanistic inquiries across disciplines.},

In the present article, all the patterns of predictable lexical ambiguity in Modern Greek Language are registered, verified and quantified as occurred in the Neurolingo computational lexicon, after a study of morpho-syntactic characteristics that differentiate the ambiguous words.},

The major products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding monohydroxydienoic acid derivative, threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid. The corresponding products from the 9-hydroperoxide were the monohydroxydienoic acid, 9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-octadec-12-enoic acid and 9,10,13-trihydroxy-octadec-11-enoic acid. 4. No separation of activities forming the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts. 5. Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts. 6. This system is compared with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives by potato extracts.},

The notions of ‘intertextuality’, ‘transtextuality’, and ‘hypertextuality/hypotextuality’ were introduced in the seventies and eighties to approach these phenomena. Through the Phœbus project, computer scientists from the computer science laboratory of the University Pierre and Marie Curie collaborate with the literary teams of Paris-Sorbonne University to develop efficient tools for literary studies that take advantage of modern computer science techniques to detect borrowings of huge masses of texts and to help put them in context. In this context, we have developed a piece of software that automatically detects and explores networks of textual reuses in classical literature. This article describes the principles on which our program is based, the significant results that have already been obtained and the prospective for the near future. It is divided into four parts. The first part recalls the distinction between various types of borrowings like plagiarism, pastiches, citations, etc. The second enumerates the criteria that are retained to characterize reuses and citations on which we are focusing here. The third part describes the implementation and shows its efficiency by comparison with manual detection. Finally, we show some of the results that have already been obtained with the Phœbus program.},

  abstract = {"Preface This book has its genesis in my PhD research at the London School of Economics. I started the degree with questions about the 2008/09 financial crisis and planned to spend most of my time researching about capital adequacy requirements. But I quickly realized much of my time would actually be spent learning the day-to-day tasks of data gathering, analysis, and results presentation. After plodding through for awhile, the breaking point came while reentering results into a regression table after I had tweaked one of my statistical models, yet again. Surely there was a better way to do research that would allow me to spend more time answering my research questions. Making research reproducible for others also means making it better organized and efficient for yourself. So, my search for a better way led me straight to the tools for reproducible computational research. The reproducible research community is very active, knowledgeable and helpful. Nonetheless, I often encountered holes in this collective knowledge, or at least had no resource to bring it all together as a whole. That is my intention for this book: to bring together the skills I have picked up for actually doing and presenting computational research. Hopefully, the book along with making reproducible research more common, will save researchers hours of Googling, so they can spend more time addressing their research questions. I would not have been able to write this book without many people's advice and support. Foremost is John Kimmel, acquisitions editor at Chapman \& Hall. He approached me with in Spring 2012 with the general idea and opportunity for this book"--},

Climate extremes are sharp, strong and sometimes protracted periods of cooling and drought caused by volcanic eruptions that in this case resulted in a negative effect on the economy of a nomadic society and were often accompanied by famine and illness. In fact, many of these natural catastrophes coincided with the Black Death pandemics among the Eastern Turks and the Chinese living in the north of China. The Turk Empire can be split into several chronological periods during which significant events that led to changes in the course of history of the nomadic state took place: AD 534–545—the rise of the Turk Empire; AD 581–583—the division of the Turk Empire into the Western and the Eastern Empires; AD 601–603—the rise of Qimin Qaghan; AD 627–630—the Eastern Turks are conquered by China; AD 679–687—the second rise of the Eastern Turk Empire. The research shows that there is clearly-discernable interplay between important historical events and climate extremes in the history of the Turk Empire. This interplay has led us to the conclusion that the climatic factor did have an impact on the historical processes that took place in the eastern part of Inner Asia, especially on the territories with a nomadic economy.},

The Islamic empire was beginning to witness the loss of Muslim territory, at the hands of either Spanish Catholics or Russian Orthodox Christians, and a reverse flow of conversion from Islam to Christianity. The territory under Muslim rule, or dār al-islām, can be divided into two parts: the frontier regions and the Muslim heartland. In the middle of the fifth/eleventh century, Asia Minor and the Balkans were entirely Christian. Yet by the middle of the tenth/sixteenth century, Muslims constituted the great majority of the population in Asia Minor and an important minority in the Balkans.},

The Afghans were to rule Iran for only seven years, and represented a transitional interlude from the Safavids to the Afshars, the second of the four eighteenth-century dynasties. Iran's centre of power was shifted east towards Central Asia, and as a consequence significant Sunni population was incorporated into what until then had been a largely Shii state. The impact of Europeans on Iran's economy had begun to be felt in the Safavid era, but the force of Europe's military and political power and rivalries, combined with European economic interests, took on ever-greater importance at the beginning of the nineteenth century.},

Inoculation of different trypanosome strains into volunteers yielded positive parasitaemia for original isolates from lion, hyaena, and Coke's hartebeest.

Tests with trypanosomes originating from experimentally mixed T. b. rhodesiense and brucei infections gave inconsistent results.

However, despite its historical and critical importance, neither the features nor the precise historical development of this shift has been the subject of systematic analysis. In this essay, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one key feature of what became known as the colloquial style: patterns of linguistic repetition. With the aid of quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of repetition is in itself a reliable metric for automatically detecting the presence of colloquial discourse. We find that colloquial repetition does indeed increase in American fiction over the course of the 19th and early 20th century, but, via comparative analysis, that this phenomenon may not be limited to American prose. Finally, we explore the semantics of these patterns of repetition, demonstrating first that repetition is broadly characteristic of represented speech in writing, and secondly that changes over time in the semantic contents of repetitions demonstrate a clear increase in colloquial, informal language.},

  abstract = {Les recherches sur le soufisme souffrent souvent d’une fâcheuse dichotomie. En effet, les unes privilégient une approche philologique centrée sur l’analyse intemporelle des doctrines ; les autres, usant des outils de l’historien, du sociologue ou de l’anthropologue, s’attachent surtout à fournir des phénomènes religieux étudiés une explication locale, mais ne sont pas assez attentives aux « traits permanents de la spiritualité en islam ». En donnant pour cadre à son travail l’islam syro-égyptien à une époque charnière de son histoire, Eric Geoffroy évite à la fois le minimalisme décevant de monographies trop étroites et le flou artistique de synthèses trop larges. Il est constamment soucieux, d’autre part, de confronter « temporel et intemporel », « histoire et métahistoire ». De ce point de vue, sa thèse apparaît donc comme une contribution significative aux efforts de tous ceux qui se préoccupent d’associer des démarches dont la cohabitation, aussi rare que féconde, conduit à remettre en cause des clichés régulièrement dénoncés mais dotés encore d’une extraordinaire résilience.  Appuyé sur l’examen scrupuleux et pénétrant de multiples sources, dont beaucoup demeurent manuscrites, cet ouvrage, écrit dans une langue ferme et claire, présente la vie religieuse - et pas seulement du soufisme stricto sensu -, à la fin de l’époque mamelouke et au début de l’ère ottomane, un tableau riche de nuances.  En définitive, c’est à bon droit qu’Eric Geoffroy affirme à la fin de son ouvrage que, sous toutes ses formes, les plus hautes ou les plus populaires, le tasawwuf occupe dans l’époque qu’il décrit une position « centrale et dominante ».

  abstract = {This volume is a collection of several papers devoted to Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505), presented on the First Conference of the School of Mamlūk Studies (held at Ca' Foscari University, Venice, from June 23 to June 25, 2014). It aims to contribute to a reassessment of the scholarly profile of the controversial but fascinating polymath and intellectual, and, more generally, to a deeper understanding of the cultural, political and academic life of the last period of the Mamlūk empire. Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī's bibliography ranges from law to theology, and from linguistics to history. It includes medicine and geography. He felt that his mission was to preserve the rich cultural heritage of the past, and knowledge in general, from widespread ignorance and decline. Considered for a long time to be an author devoid of any originality and a "simple" compiler, this polymath was in fact an excellent teacher and a rigorous scholar who had a meticulous and accurate working method. With contributions by: Christopher D. Bahl; Mustafa Banister; Joel Blecher; Stephen R. Burge; Daniela Rodica Firanescu; Éric Geoffroy; Antonella Ghersetti; Francesco Grande; Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila; Takao Ito; Judith Kindinger; Christian Mauder; Aaron Spevack},

This paper uses data on about 100 nations to address this aspect, focusing on the long, medium and short-term research intensity. Across two measures of a nation's institutional history, we find that broader national stability positively affects research intensity both in the long and the medium terms, while the narrower path dependence measure supports these findings, albeit with weak statistical significance. The effects on short-term research intensity lack statistical support across both measures. Comparing institutional path dependence with research inertia, we find that both factors significantly affect research intensity. The main findings are robust to various modifications.},

The study resulted in a rich collection of different types of graphics, data provenance, and relationships between text, graphics, and data. Based on this corpus, we present a systematic overview of word-scale graphic designs, and examine how designers used them. We also discuss the designers’ goals in creating their graphics, and characterize how they used word-scale graphics to visualize data, add emphasis, and create alternative narratives. Building on these examples, we discuss implications for the design of authoring tools for word-scale graphics and visualizations, and explore how new authoring environments could make it easier for designers to integrate them into documents.},

In this magisterial work, Goldthwaite brings together a lifetime of research and insight on the subject, clarifying and explaining the complex workings of Florence's commercial, banking, and artisan sectors. Florence was one of the most industrialized cities in medieval Europe, thanks to its thriving textile industries. The importation of raw materials and the exportation of finished cloth necessitated the creation of commercial and banking practices that extended far beyond Florence's boundaries. Part I situates Florence within this wider international context and describes the commercial and banking networks through which the city's merchant-bankers operated. Part II focuses on the urban economy of Florence itself, including various industries, merchants, artisans, and investors. It also evaluates the role of government in the economy, the relationship of the urban economy to the region, and the distribution of wealth throughout the society. While political, social, and cultural histories of Florence abound, none focuses solely on the economic history of the city. The Economy of Renaissance Florence offers both a systematic description of the city's major economic activities and a comprehensive overview of its economic development from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance to 1600},

There was no expectation that they be performed. Even in Galileo's dialogues, the distinction between real experiments and imaginary ones is not sharp (see galileo). During the seventeenth century, performance and public description became essential to the probative power of experiment. These made its methods and procedures transparent, allowing any reader of the narrative to be a virtual witness of an active demonstration (Shapin and Schaffer 1985, pp. 22?79). Thus, by the end of the scientific revolution, illustrative narratives were distinguished from public accounts of experiment as the disciplined, systematic study of phenomena. Eventually this made the efficacy of thought experiments problematic (see Kuhn 1977, pp. 241?2, and thought experiments). As a source of experience of realms previously beyond the reach of the senses, real?world experiment contributed to the rise of objective scientific knowledge. Harvey, Galileo, Hooks, Boyle, Newton, and other proponents of experimental natural philosophy established an important new mode of argumentation.},

This study examines sets of quantitative and qualitative data to explore the usage of MONK as a research tool: the author analyzes eighteen months of web analytics data from the MONK website and responses from five interviews with MONK users to examine the ways in which MONK has been most commonly used by researchers. In the paper's analysis, the author considers the implications of MONK's use in digital humanities research and teaching, and how a digital humanities tool such as MONK can be maintained for public use. This study ultimately explores how user studies of digital humanities tools can reveal insights into humanities scholars' needs for using digital tools to pursue new research methodologies, and argues that studying the usability and preservation of digital humanities tools will enable information professionals to address humanities scholars' needs for their digital scholarship.},

Harley is in town to work with the local Heritage Museum, and Douglas is there to tear down the town's beloved old Bent Bridge, so from day one they are on a collision course; but out of this unpromising union comes something unexpected, something even better than perfection.},

And why is history - especially long-term history - so essential to understanding the multiple pasts which gave rise to our conflicted present? The History Manifesto is a call to arms to historians and everyone interested in the role of history in contemporary society. Leading historians Jo Guldi and David Armitage identify a recent shift back to longer-term narratives, following many decades of increasing specialisation, which they argue is vital for the future of historical scholarship and how it is communicated. This provocative and thoughtful book makes an important intervention in the debate about the role of history and the humanities in a digital age. It will provoke discussion among policymakers, activists and entrepreneurs as well as ordinary listeners, viewers, readers, students and teachers. This title is also available as open access.},

These texts combine the instrumental approach of compiling knowledge for the court with literary traditions in local historiography. This article explores these local geographical writings through theories on identity and space, arguing that these texts reflect the shifting spatial imagination of Persianate elites in the context of rapid social and economic change. These texts are an alternate entry point for viewing the politics of identity in Qājār Iran, challenging the teleological approach to the emergence of nationalism in secondary literature. Taking the close relationship between territory and community as a starting point, this article argues that expressions of regional socio-economic unities, which are a key feature of the geographical writings of Iranian elites, reflect the consolidation of regional identities.},

The tools developed by Interedition’s ‘Prototyping’ working group were tested by other research teams, which formulate strategic recommendations. To this purpose, the Centre for Manuscript Genetics (University of Antwerp), the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (The Hague), and the University of Würzburg have been working together within the framework of Interedition. One of the concrete results of collaboration is the development and fine-tuning of the text collation tool CollateX.2 In this article, we would like to investigate how the architecture of a digital archive containing modern manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users can autonomously collate textual units of their choice with the help of the collation tool CollateX and thus decide for themselves how efficiently this digital architecture functions—as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or as an edition. The first part introduces CollateX and its internal concepts and heuristics as a tool for digitally supported collation. How this tool can be integrated in the infrastructure of an electronic edition is discussed in part two. The third and final part examines the possibility of deploying CollateX for the collation of modern manuscripts by means of a test case: the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (www.beckettarchive.org).},

Using a prosopographical approach, it focuses on the office of the qāḍī as an intersection of imperial and provincial authority, using the cities of Ḥarrān, al-Raqqa, and al- Mawṣil as case studies. A comparative analysis of the individuals appointed to the qāḍīship reveals some commonalities in their backgrounds, particularly regarding ḥadīth transmission, but also clear differences in the appointment patterns identified for each city. For example, the office of the qāḍī of Ḥarrān seems to have been a predominantly local affair, while Raqqan qāḍīs frequently held transregional elite status. The judges of al-Mawṣil, on the other hand, feature local, regional, and transregional representatives. This variance is likely due to political and administrative factors and emphasizes the complex dynamics and hierarchies of governance in the early Islamic period.},

The article traces the development of the term elite in scholarly discourse from the 19th century onward and presents its own definition suited to the complex organizational structure of early Islamic society, pointing out both the challenges of and possible strategies for studying early Islamic elites.},

Communications depended on landscape and climatic conditions, of course, but a series of major strategic routes connected these different cultural and geographical zones. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that road building and bridge building were on several occasions carried out using the skills of Roman captives during the third and fourth centuries. The city was one of the most important features of the late ancient landscape, both in respect of the social organisation of production and the ownership and control of resources in land and manpower. Cities and urban centres in the Sasanian world occupied a somewhat different role in the structure of the state, although they were similar in respect of some of their social and economic functions.},

  abstract = {Authorship verification is a branch of forensic authorship analysis addressing the following task: Given a number of sample documents of an author A and a document allegedly written by A , the task is to decide whether the author of the latter document is truly A or not. We present a scalable authorship verification method that copes with this problem across different languages, genres and topics. The central concept of our method is a model, which is trained with Dutch, English, Greek, Spanish and German text documents. The model sets for each language specific parameters and a threshold that accepts or rejects the alleged author as A . The proposed method offers a wide range of benefits, e.g., a universal (static) threshold for each language and scalability regarding almost any involved component (classification function, ensemble strategy, features, etc.). Furthermore, the method benefits from low runtime due to the fact that no natural language processing techniques nor other computationally-intensive methods are involved. In our experiments, we applied the method on 28 test corpora including 4525 verification cases across 16 genres and a huge number of mixed topics, where we achieved competitive results (75\% median accuracy). With these results we were able to outperform two state-of-the-art baselines, given the same training and test corpora.},

The book offers a chronological exploration of Byzantium and the outlook of its rulers during the time of the Crusades. It argues that one of the main keys to Byzantine interaction with Western Europe, the Crusades and the crusader states can be found in the nature of the Byzantine Empire and the ideology which underpinned it, rather than in any generalised hostility between the peoples. Taking recent scholarship into account, this new edition includes an updated notes section and bibliography, as well as significant additions to the text: new material on the role of religious differences after 1100, a detailed discussion of economic, social and religious changes that took place in 12th-century Byzantine relations with the west, in-depth coverage of Byzantium and the Crusades during the 13th century, new maps, illustrations, genealogical tables and a timeline of key dates. Byzantium and the Crusades is an important contribution to the historiography by a major scholar in the field that should be read by anyone interested in Byzantine and crusader history"--},

  abstract = {The canon of biblical books is frequently cited as a parallel to a unitary literary canon that, though often presumed, is in fact not to be found. The biblical canon was created for the purpose of forestalling change and exiling competition. There are at least ten kinds of literary canons, all ultimately resulting from selections made for such distinct purposes as providing models, transmitting a heritage, creating common frames of reference, logrolling, legitimating theory, historicizing, and pluralizing. Canons formed for any of these purposes necessarily yield to change over time and compete with one another at any given time. We can reasonably expect neither the abolition of selective canons nor agreement on a single one; we can, however, seek clarity about purposes.},

  abstract = {The sociological dimensions of the development of a sectarian orientation in early Imami Shiʿism have remained sparsely explored since Marshall Hodgson posed the question ‘How did the early Shia become sectarian?’ in 1955. This article explores Imamic hadith statements on the canonical ritual payment of zakāt/ṣadaqa as a way of tracking the crystallisation of communitarian boundaries. It argues that the Shiʿi Imams, especially Imam Bāqir, fit into a common Muslim discourse regarding the payment of zakāt, for example in the case of an unjust Imam. However, the hadiths of the Imam Ṣādiq show a pivot towards the more clearly differentiated Shiʿi juristic positions of the Occultation period. Imamic statements on zakāt, therefore, must be seen as neither identical to Sunni positions, nor to classical Twelver Shiʿi formulations, but rather as dynamic responses to developing circumstances. In using Imamic hadiths to track early Shiʿi doctrine, this article also suggests directions for the development of a methodology for using hadiths to track historical developments, a venture which has barely begun. In dealing with the Shiʿi Hadith corpus, the author calls for an epistemological scepticism, coupled with a methodological positivism, assuming that while Imamic hadiths may merely act as mouthpieces for later doctrinal positions, it is also very possible that they do originate in the circles of the Imams to whom they are ascribed, and should be analysed as such in order to track chronological developments in the Hadith corpus.Keywords: Minorities, sectarianism, Shia, Shiʿism, Hadith, Islamic law, zakāt, ṣadaqa, alms, taxation, charity, group identity},

The second legacy was the Mamlūk occupation of the relatively rich province of Yemen, domination over which meant tax revenues, the effective protection of the Ḥijāz from the south and control of the trade that crossed into the Red Sea.

DH is defined as involuntary, uninhibited detrusor contractions. The physiology and pathophysiology of the micturition reflex is reviewed. The balance between cerebral stimulation and supraspinal inhibition is discussed. DH is caused by disturbances in this balance. Whereas increased afferent impulses to the central nervous system due to local disorders in bladder and/or urethra may produce DH, a neurological disorder affecting the inhibitory nervous pathways from cortical and subcortical centres always result in uninhibited detrusor contractions. DH was found in 25\% of 2000 patients. In the majority of the patients the DH was caused by a neurological disorder. The incidence of DH in patients with enuresis, gynecological patients with urinary incontinence and/or genital prolapse and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is reported. In 62\% of the patients with BPH the DH was eliminated after adequate surgical treatment of the infravesical obstruction. By contrast, DH in women with genital prolapse and/or incontinence persisted despite operative treatment. In a retrospective investigation of 152 patients with DH, the cause of the DH was unknown in 32 patients (21\%). A clinical neurological examination revealed no evidence of neurological disease in 45\% of the 22 patients examined. Voiding symptoms were the only complaint in these patients as well as in 30-40\% of the patients in the other groups mentioned. This calls for improved investigatory methods in the evaluation of the balance between stimulation and inhibition of the micturition reflex. The presence of uninhibited detrusor contractions in apparently healthy patients should indicate a neurological examination since DH may be the first sign of a neurological disorder. The micturition reflex is conducted through long, uninterrupted neurons with a marked central integration. Therefore cystometry may be used as a supplement to the clinical neurological examination in the early diagnosis of pyramidal or extrapyramidal central nervous system disorders.},

If the essential significance of "jihad" as righteous cause (i.e., action for the sake of a moral order) is shown to have been variously altered according to the needs and conditions of the Muslim community, significant possibilities arise for a contemporary understanding of "jihad" that is relevant to the needs and circumstances of the Muslim community today. Some features of the "jihad" tradition, although specific to a particular period and with little relevance today, continue to inform the current discussion on "jihad." Discussion of the "jihad" tradition, then, should take care to distinguish the historically incidental features of the tradition from those with an enduring relevancy. By doing so, the "jihad" tradition will be able to contribute to discussions on the relation of religion to the public order and political organization, even those not limited to Islam.},

  abstract = {This book highlights the quantitative methods of data mining and information visualization and explores their use in relation to the films and writings of the Russian director, Dziga Vertov. The theoretical basis of the work harkens back to the time when a group of Russian artists and scholars, known as the “formalists,” developed new concepts of how art could be studied and measured. This book brings those ideas to the digital age. One of the central questions the book intends to address is, “How can hypothetical notions in film studies be supported or falsified using empirical data and statistical tools?” The first stage involves manual and computer-assisted annotation of the films, leading to the production of empirical data which is then used for statistical analysis but more importantly for the development of visualizations. Studies of this type furthermore shed light on the field of visual presentation of time-based processes; an area which has its origin in the Russian formalist sphere of the 1920s and which has recently gained new relevance due to technological advances and new possibilities for computer-assisted analysis of large and complex data sets. In order to reach a profound understanding of Vertov and his films, the manual or computer-assisted data analysis must be combined with film-historical knowledge and a study of primary sources. In addition, the status of the surviving film materials and the precise analysis of these materials combined with knowledge of historical film technology provide insight into archival policy and political culture in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 30s.},

After an introduction to legal taxation and Saljī˒q fiscal policy, the philological problems of a specific due, al-fissa, illegitimate according to the shariūa, will be addressed along with its political function, history, levying and transfer. It was levied in Damascus for an annual and/or occasional tribute to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, even before the alliance of Damascus and Jerusalem in 532/1140. Before Nūr al-Dīn Mahmūd's conquest of Damascus the monies were transferred by bearers oihawälas. It can be suggested that tax farmers were liable for them. A decree, rasm, allowed for the collection of al-fissa. The due was levied perhaps on the basis of an assessment of urban real estate. An interpretation of the term al-fissa was suggested as Arabic borrowing from the middle Latin term fossa.},

It probably came into being during the 160s/780s when the 'old market of the caliph Hishām' was transferred from within al-Raqqa to the free land between the two cities. The decision of Hārūn al-Rashīd to reside in al-Raqqa created a new demand, and consequently glass furnaces and pottery kilns were set up for mass production. A road running from the east gate of al-Rāfiqa connected this area. After 198/213 the governor of the west, Ṭāhir ibn al-Ḥusain, erected a wall north of the area in order to protect it from Bedouin raids. During the third/ninth century at the latest the area developed into a third urban entity. Al-Muqaddasī mentions an al-Raqqa al-Muḥtariqa. The identification with the commercial and industrial area is proposed. The decline of al-Raqqa al-Muḥtariqa began in the 270s/880s and 280s/890s. The devastating rule of the Ḥamdânids probably marks its end.},

Money as a means of coordinating human decisions and economic exchange is a complex social invention. Islamic legal theory determined the value of money to be identical with the intrinsic value of the bullion. The Zubayrid governor had targeted the ideological, religious deficiencies of the Umayyad regime. The Ismaili Shiite Fatimids challenged the Abbasid claim of universal rulership both ideologically and militarily, and thus their coinage named only the Fatimid caliph. After their conquest of Egypt their coins presented a visual distinction to the classical late Abbasid coinage, moving towards a design consisting mainly of rings of concentric inscriptions.},

  abstract = {The final centuries BCE (Before Common Era) saw the main focus of trade between the Far East and Europe switch from the so called Northern Route across the Asian steppes to the classical silk roads. The cities across central Asia flourished and grew in size and importance. While clearly there were political, economic and cultural drivers for these changes, there may also have been a role for changes in climate in this relatively arid region of Asia. Analysis of a new ensemble of snapshot global climate model simulations, run every 250 years over the last 6000 years, allows us to assess the long term climatological changes seen across the central Asian arid region through which the classical Silk Roads run. While the climate is comparatively stable through the Holocene, the fluctuations seen in these simulations match significant cultural developments in the region. From 1500 BCE the deterioration of climate from a transient precipitation peak, along with technological development and the immigration of Aryan nomads, drove a shift towards urbanization and probably irrigation, culminating in the founding of the major cities of Bukhara and Samarkand around 700–500 BCE. Between 1000 and 250 BCE the modelled precipitation in the central Asian arid region undergoes a transition towards wetter climates. The changes in the Western Disturbances, which is the key weather system for central Asian precipitation, provides 10\% more precipitation and the increased hydrological resources may provide the climatological foundation for the golden era of Silk Road trade.},

These archival practices were spread across the Mamluk realm and involved numerous actors, which included the central bureaucracy in Cairo, individual secretaries, and, most importantly, the small-scale administration managed by officers.

The issue of space has deeply influenced reflections on periodization as is, evident, for instance, within changed frameworks such as global history and new fields of study, such as Mediterranean or Indian Ocean Studies. For the Middle East, the rise of the concept of Late Antiquity has proven to be a particularly fruitful spatial reconfiguration that has changed established notions of periodization. The second major impact on the questions of periodization has come from changing thematic foci, most importantly, the diversification of historical studies away from the primacy of political history. In the field of Middle Eastern history, this has been particularly pertinent on account of the prominent position that dynastic periodizations have held. Finally, notions of periodization have undergone changes as the question of historical agency has been reconsidered. In the study of non-European history, such changes emerged in particular as an outcome of reflections on the degree to which such societies’ histories followed patterns derived from European models. The article argues that the contributions to this volume open up new venues to think of the question of periodization in Middle Eastern history by taking a long-term perspective from early Islam to the present day.},

  abstract = {This article examines the development of the pharaoh as a literary figure in~Arabic historiography between the third/ninth and the ninth/fifteenth~centuries. The first aim is to reflect upon the changing narrative structure of~such anecdotes in texts ranging from the universal chronicle of al-Ṭabarī~(d. 310/923) to the regional chronicle of al-Maqrīzī (d. 845/1442). The~article’s second concern is to evaluate the plurality of meanings that~emerged from these changes. This discussion is then linked to detailed~consideration of the authors’ social contexts, with particular focus on that~of al-Maqrīzī. The nexus between literary approach and social history that~is proposed here offers a deeper understanding of the function of narrative~resources that moved from text to text. Not only was this a salient feature~of Arabic historiography, but also it allows us to reconsider the repeated appearance of such elements beyond describing them as simply ‘borrowing’ or ‘copying’. Indeed, the discussion concludes that authors~skilfully drew from a pool of narrative devices and artfully established~intertextual allusions across both time and genres.},

For example, what missionary or warlike project of Pope Julius in the Near East prompted the translation and production of a Catholic book of Hours in Arabic? What local usage does the book follow? Or perhaps it follows the Eastern Orthodox usage rather than the Western. These are questions that some scholar may solve in the future. That the book was intended to attract adherents of Islam is clear by the opening lines of the various sections which imitate the beginnings of the sections of the Koran, "In the name of God, the Ever-living, the Eternal," etc. If it were translated into Turkish, it might well be connected with the overtures made by Pope Julius to the Turks shortly before his death, but the Arabic text would seem to preclude that supposition.]},

Corruption of language is our target. Sounding ambiguity in crisis writings versus fictions, we use tools that signal shades of meaning that allow for alternative reading. From Empson (Seven Types of Ambiguity. London: Random House, 2004) seven types of ambiguity, we scouted and built out four we could set up in digital format: (1) vagueness, (2) contronyms, (3) polysemous words, and (4) unusual juxtapositions of words in rum sequences. We feed these markers of ambiguity on a computer-aided text analysis build-out to trace how ambiguity in leaders’ cant changes with time. We marshaled speeches by President Putin and NATO Secretary Rasmussen (Ukrainian crisis), President Medvedev and President Saakashvili (Russian intervention in Georgia), and speeches by President Saddam Hussein. Novels completed the corpus, Henry James’ The Bostonians, and Flaubert’s Sentimental Education and its original French version, L’Éducation Sentimentale. We suspect ambiguity to be diversely at work in each of these data sets. The four markers of ambiguity increase over time in Putin, Saakashvili, and Hussein; they decrease in NATO, Medvedev, and in James and Flaubert. Across the samples, correlations between the four markers are high and significant.},

These narratives often depicted Lutheranism and Calvinism as more modern and more progressive forms of religion, which replaced a decaying and outmoded medieval Catholicism. Because of their interest in religious practices, social historians have been more focused on the similar goals and aims of reformed Protestantism and reformed Catholicism, such as the goal of both to instill greater social and moral discipline in an effort to remake the kingdom of Christ on earth, than in the obvious doctrinal disputes that divided them. These contributions are most noticeable in several key areas--lay piety, rituals, gender and marriage, confessionalization and social discipline, and transmission of ideas through print, images, and education--and the greatest potential for future research lies in these same areas.},

  abstract = {I argue that McGann’s Radiant Textuality (2001), shaped by postmodern literary theory and the nature of electronic texts, is wrong-headed–that McGann’s valorization of the instability of texts and interpretation leads to poor results. It concentrates on three examples: a scanner experiment that leads to the dictum that “no text is self-identical,” a “deformance” of Stevens’s “The Snowman” that results in the claim that the poem is noun-heavy, and a discussion of Joyce Kilmer’s “Trees” that suggests it is a good modernist poem about sex. I claim that, on the contrary, texts are remarkably stable, Stevens uses only an average number of nouns, and “Trees” can be better understood by focusing more closely upon and altering its language. In all three cases, McGann’s approach, because it so consistently points away from the text, provides little insight into the nature of text and interpretation, while a text-centered, language-centered approach is much more illuminating.},

  abstract = {Computational stylistics has often analyzed variations in the style of a single author or text, including chronological change, the dialogue or narration of multiple characters or narrators in a single novel, and other perceived shifts in style. Here, I examine intra-textual style variation from a different perspective, and suggest circumstances under which it is appropriate and beneficial to omit some parts of texts from an analysis to eliminate sources of predictable and intrusive variation that would render other kinds of variation or consistency of style invisible. In other cases it may be appropriate to randomize a text to mask a kind of variation that would otherwise disrupt an analysis. One way to do this is by sorting the lines of the text in random order before analyzing it in sections. In analyses in which texts of very different lengths must be compared, it is also beneficial to randomize the longer parts, cut them all to approximately the length of the shortest one, and use the equalized amounts of text to create a word frequency list that is not biased in favor of the longer parts. These techniques can lead to a deeper understanding of style variation.},

The first section considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Section two, organized around the dynamic relationship between the material book and the mutable text, develops a loosely chronological narrative from early writing, through manuscript and early printing, to the institution of a mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization of publishing and the introduction of the electronic book. A third section takes a practical turn, discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies"--},

Phonetic systems try to respond to the succession of sounds that make up a word, based on the irreducible elements used in speaking. In an ideographic system, each word is represented by a single sign that is unrelated to the sounds of the word itself, but expresses the idea which the word represents. The classic example of an ideographic writing system is Chinese. There is a common misunderstanding that treats each Chinese character as a separate sign. Hanzi (the system of Chinese Characters) serves as a kind of common information carrier created and shared by the whole Chinese society, and as such it is obviously neither disorderly nor unsystematic. On the contrary, there must be some intrinsic laws that make Hanzi the most mature ideographic system in the world. As Complex Network analysis has become an effective tool to analyze complex systems, this article aims to use some of these methods to identify such intrinsic laws of the Hanzi system.},

Roman rule was now only a dim memory, recalled in the ruins of its monuments and in the resurgence of Byzantine military power along Syria's northern borderlands. Syrians might soon come to feel that a relatively stable and tolerant Arab-Muslim government was no worse than the disruption and turmoil of the last decades of Byzantine rule. The symbolic impact of Muslim rule may have been even greater, for the new regime was no longer a Christian commonwealth, a providential vehicle of salvation. The first governor was Abd Allah ibn Ali, the powerful uncle of al-Saffah and al-Mansur who had led the victorious Abbasid armies into Syria. In the late third/ninth century Syria suddenly entered on an era of sustained turbulence, in common with many parts of the Islamic world.},

Using a Variable Length n-Gram Feature Extraction Algorithm, principal component analysis and average linkage clustering we are able to show that 24 sutras, attributed by the tradition to different translators, were in fact translated by the same translator or group of translators. Since part of our method is based on assigning weight to n-grams, the analysis is capable of yielding distinctive features, i.e. strings of Chinese characters, that are characteristic of the translator(s). This is the first time that these techniques have successfully been applied to medieval Chinese texts. The results of this study open up a number of new directions for the lexicographic and syntactic study of early Chinese translations of Buddhist texts.},

  abstract = {The Arabic philosophical fable Hayy Ibn Yaqzan is a classic of medieval Islamic philosophy. Ibn Tufayl (d. 1185), the Andalusian philosopher, tells of a child raised by a doe on an equatorial island who grows up to discover the truth about the world and his own place in it, unaided—but also unimpeded—by society, language, or tradition. Hayy’s discoveries about God, nature, and man challenge the values of the culture in which the tale was written as well as those of every contemporary society.Goodman’s commentary places Hayy Ibn Yaqzan in its historical and philosophical context. The volume features a new preface and index, and an updated bibliography.“One of the most remarkable books of the Middle Ages.”—Times Literary Supplement“An enchanting and puzzling story. . . . The book transcends all historical and cultural environments to settle upon the questions of human life that perpetually intrigue men.”—Middle East Journal“Goodman has done a service to the modern English reader by providing a readable translation of a philosophically significant allegory.”—Philosophy East and West“Add[s] bright new pieces to an Islamic mosaic whose general shape is already known.”—American Historical Review},

Conflicting results were overcome by extracting stable information from the tested range of diverse parameter results of Rolling Delta, and by establishing majority attributions of the text chunks with Rolling Classify. Both approaches were applied to the well-recognized 1911 edition of the play, prepared by W. Greg. This followed the given folio sequence 3a–22a and then made the various additions. Each of the additions was not long enough to establish convincing results as to its authorship, but the folio sequences of the original text could be analysed with larger and reliable window sizes, revealing Samuel Rowley and William Shakespeare as authors. The long-standing claim that Munday or Chettle is the author of the original text of the play proved to be unsustainable. As far as the conventional dating is concerned, an earlier analysis of Thomas of Woodstock, largely written by Rowley, and in part by Shakespeare, points, if later revisions are disregarded, to the period 1592–93.},

As collaborative scenarios count among the assets of these relatively new stylometric tools, it became possible to tip the scales towards Glatzer’s view that the plays have two authors, and Leishman’s advocacy of one author, based on the manuscript prologue of Part 2 of The Return, gave way to a ‘battle of the plays’ between Marston and Nashe.},

Two events in the late 960s/1550s changed the strategic balance between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires. First, in 964/1556, Charles V abdicated. His son Philip II inherited his territories in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, but not the Holy Roman empire, leading to a split in the Spanish and Austrian branches of the dynasty. Second, in 968/1559 Philip II and Henry II of France concluded a peace at Cateau-Cambrésis, removing the possibility of a Franco- Ottoman alliance and undermining Ottoman influence in the politics of western Europe. The effect of Ottoman operations in the southern seas was to create a land frontier against the Portuguese.},

Upward sweeps are defined as instances in which the largest sovereign polity in a network of fighting and allying polities significantly increases in size. Collapses are instances in which the size of the largest polity greatly decreases and stays down for a significant period of time (centuries). We use regional interpolity systems rather than single polities as the unit of analysis, following the comparative world-systems framework. We are limited to those regions and time periods for which quantitative estimates of largest polity sizes are available. We compare the frequencies of cycles and sweeps across five interpolity networks, and find more similarities than differences across the five systems. This is somewhat surprising because most studies that compare East Asia with the West stress important differences. We find a total of 22 upsweeps and 19 downsweeps across the five systems, but only three instances of prolonged system-wide collapse. We also find that the frequency of cycles increased over the long run, while the frequencies of upsweeps and downsweeps did not display long-term trends. The lack of a downward trend in downsweeps challenges the supposition that resilience grows with sociocultural complexity and size.},

The north-western districts of the Punjab, as we shall see, lay within the penumbra of Mongol sovereignty.

A change of tempo is visible during Ala al-Din Khalji's reign in the context of relations with independent Hindu kingdoms. Both the successful resistance to major Mongol attacks during Ala al-Din's era and the pronounced territorial expansion over which he presided were made possible by administrative measures which greatly extended the area under the sultan's direct control and subjected it to a uniform system of land-tax.},

Participants included 15 highly trained pianists and 21 individuals with little or no formal music training. The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender distribution, and socioeconomic status. Musicians showed superior immediate and delayed recall of word lists and greater use of a semantic clustering strategy during initial list-learning than nonmusicians. They also exhibited superior learning, delayed recall, and delayed recognition for visual designs. Group differences in delayed free recall of both words and designs persisted after controlling statistically for estimated Full Scale IQ. These results suggest that extensive music training is associated with a generalized enhancement of auditory and visual memory functions.},

  abstract = {In the Near East the first five centuries after the Hijra (622-1106 A.D.) were dominated by the spread of Islam and the growth of Muslim states, and both developments were dependent on writing materials. This dissertation traces the history of writing materials and related crafts, craftsmen, and procedures during that period. From rough beginnings in the time of Muhammad (PBUH) through an efflorescence in the first century of ('c)Abbasid rule, the stationer's trade touched on a wide variety of technological developments and was involved in a similarly wide range of intellectual and administrative changes. The craft of wiraqah, 'stationery' in the broadest sense, was an institution which came to exercise significant political, social, and economic influence. Its initial growth, however, was due to the central role of the Qur'an in Islam, and it continued to be closely tied to spiritual and intellectual life in the prosperous ('c)Abbasid capital of Baghdad. The dissertation treats both the religious-intellectual and administrative aspects of the growing use of paper; it also touches on the writing materials used among the Arabs before the advent of paper, and the complex route by which that invention came from China via Samarqand into the world of Islam. Paper-manufacturing centers are surveyed, and the trade in stationery, the traders, and their trading places are treated, along with auxiliary crafts, notably copying and bookbinding. The processes of writing books and selling them are also explored, with attention to the public character of much composition in the medieval period. The dissertation draws largely on Arabic annalistic and belletristic sources, notably Ibn al-Nad(')im and Yaqut, modern papyrological, bibliographical, and codicological studies, though they are few in number, are also drawn on to supplement the literary sources.},

Being a relatively simple task for modern languages, the collation of medieval text traditions ranges from the complex to the virtually impossible depending on the degree of instability of textual transmission. We present a visual analytics environment that supports computationally aligning such complex textual differences typical of orally inflected medieval poetry. For the purpose of analyzing alignment, we provide interactive visualizations for different text hierarchy levels, specifically, a meso reading view to support investigating repetition and variance at the line level across text segments. In addition to outlining important aspects of our interdisciplinary collaboration, we emphasize the utility of the proposed system by various usage scenarios in medieval French literature.},

  abstract = {This article describes the development and application of an innovative tool, Text Re-use Alignment Visualization (TRAViz), whose aim is to visualize variation between editions of both historical and modern texts. Reading different editions of a text empowers research in literary studies and linguistics, where one can study a text’s reception or follow the development of its language over time. One of the purposes of a text edition is to trace or reconstruct a possible archetype or something that might be considered to be an original version of the text in order to better understand its evolution over time. To do so, the textual scholar examines and records the similarities and the differences between a number of exemplars in what is known as a ‘critical apparatus’. The result of this variant analysis can be visually represented as a ‘Variant Graph’, where the relationships between these exemplars can be more easily studied. Variant Graphs can be, in turn, visualized in order to facilitate reading and interaction with the source data. Borrowing from existing digital tools, TRAViz assists the scholar in the collation process by specifically focusing on design and user engagement, concurrently seeking to simplify interaction as a means of encouraging humanists to adopt the tool. The article will describe the needs and rationale behind the creation of TRAViz by exploring existing research, describing its functionality through examples, and by finally discussing how its application can influence future development of this tool in particular and of the field in general.},

It suggests more attention to the material and cultural determinations of slaves' lives, to the condition of enslaved humanity and to the everyday processes of political action among the enslaved as alternative approaches. Finally, it argues that the injunction to "give the slaves back their agency" was a scholarly call to arms which was meaningful at the moment in which the New Social History emerged, but which has now lost its political salience and suggests that if historians are to continue to frame their scholarship as an act of historical redress, they should do so in terms more suited to the current circumstances.},

  abstract = {Two famous, firsthand accounts of the holy war in the Middle Ages translated by Caroline Smith Originally composed in Old French, the two chronicles brought together here offer some of the most vivid and reliable accounts of the Crusades from a Western perspective. Villehardouin's Conquest of Constantinople, distinguished by its simplicity and lucidity, recounts the controversial Fourth Crusade, which descended into an all-out attack on the E astern Christians of Byzantium. In Life of Saint Louis, Joinville draws on his close attachment to King Louis IX of France to recall his campaigning in the Holy Land. Together these narratives comprise a fascinating window on events that, for all their remoteness, offer startling similarities to our own age.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The volume also contains analyses of individual biographies and discussions of Ibn 'Asākir's treatment of larger classes of people, including the first analysis of his biographies of women.

Focusing on “enumerative games” (Mainberger), the article does not ask what the enumerated elements mean, but how the act of enumerating produces meaning. In the first part, the article discusses elements central to the poetics of the enumerative (including items, length, arrangement, and frame). In the second part it deals with the politics of enumeration in the example of al-Shidyāq’s {$<$}em{$>$}al-Sāq ʿalā al-sāq fī mā huwa al-Fāriyāq{$<$}/em{$>$} (1855).

  abstract = {‘Authorship attribution’, the problem of determining the author (or the author's attributes, such as gender, age, native language, or other characteristics) by examining the writing style of an unknown work, is an important problem in applied linguistics. The theory of authorship attribution is relatively straightforward: language is an underspecified system, and people can pick and choose among several different ways to describe the same thing. These choices, in turn, become habituated and can be identified as persistent patterns of an individual or group of writers.One important psycholinguistic underpinning to this solution is the universal existence (in natural languages) of so-called “marker words” or ‘function words,’–little, closed-class words that do not carry much semantics but instead denote relationships between content words. Because these words are so lightly processed, writers/speakers can choose among many different near-synonymous forms, and implicitly express their identity in doing so.Do constructed languages have this same degree of near-synonymity? We present the results of a study of authorship attribution using an ad-hoc corpus of fan-written documents in various constructed languages, and show that even artificial languages constructed for artistic purposes, such as Klingon, Na'vi, and Elvish, permit this type of analysis. This indicates that even constructed languages tend to be psycholinguistically plausible.},

This protocol (or close variants of it) has been used in at least four separate cases across a wide variety of documents and consumers. It is mathematically supported while still being easy to understand.

The individual subjects we tackle are (in order): logic and proof, discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, probability and statistics, calculus, and differential equations. This is not at all the order in which these subjects are usually taught in school curricula, and indeed, it is possible to take a course of study that does not include all of them.

These changes are explained by recent challenges for social history writing such as the shifts of European societies away from the classical topics of social history, the trend of internationalization, the cultural turn and the upheaval of 1989/90. The end of the article presents what might be future topics of social history: the return to the history of burning social questions, the social history of politics, the cultural enlargement of social history and the social history of Europe as a whole.},

Although it focuses primarily on the period from 1270 during which \&apos;Ethiopian\&apos; was a national rather than ethnic identity, it shares several themes with other papers in this volume. After considering the manner in which Christianity reached Ethiopia and in particular the central role played by the royal court in the acceptance and consolidation of the Church, attention is given to the claims of successive Ethiopian rulers and ethnic groups to be \&apos;Israelites\&apos;, that is, descendants of biblical figures most notably King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The paper next considers the manner in which monastic movements, which emerged in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were associated with ethnically based resistance to the expansion of the Christian kingdom. Other themes include the development of a tradition of biblical interpretation and Christological controversies. The paper concludes with a discussion of ongoing research concerning the Ethiopian diaspora which has developed in the period since the Marxist revolution of 1974.},

The essay provides an overview of the state of Qur’anic studies in Iran today, aiming to examine the extent of the impact of studies by Western scholars on Iranian academic circles during the last three decades and the relationship between them. As in most Islamic countries, the major bulk of academic activity in Iran in this field used to be undertaken by the traditional ‘ulamā’; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century and the establishment of universities and other academic institutions in the Islamic world, there has been increasing diversity and development. After the Islamic Revolution, many gradual changes in the structure and approach of centres of religious learning and universities have occurred. Contemporary advancements in modern sciences and communications technologies have gradually brought the institutions engaged in the study of human sciences to confront the new context. As a result, the traditional Shī‘ī centres of learning, which until 50 years ago devoted themselves exclusively to the study of Islamic law and jurisprudence, today pay attention to the teaching of foreign languages, Qur’anic sciences and exegesis, including Western studies about the Qur’an, to a certain extent, and recognise the importance of almost all of the human sciences of the West. تغيرت مكانة التفسير والدراسات القرآنية في جمهورية ﺇيران الإسلامية تغيرﺍﹰ كبيرﺍﹰ في العقود الأخيرة . ﺗﻘﺪﹼم هذه المقالة نبذة عن الوضع الحالي للدراسات القرآنية في ﺇيران، وﺗﻘﻴﹼﻢ مدى ﺗﺄﺛﻴﺮ الدراسات التي ينتجها باحثون غربيون على الأكاديميين الإيرانيين خلال العقود الثلاثة الأخيرة، والعلاقات بين الطرفين . ففي ﺇيران، كما الحال في معظم الدول الإسلامية الأخرى، كان معظم ﺍﻟﻌﻤﻞ الأكاديمي في هذا المجال حكرﺍﹰ على العلماء التقليديين . لكن منذ بداية القرن العشرين ومع إنشاء جامعات ومعاهد أكاديمية أخرى في العالم الإسلامي، ﺇزداد التنوع والتطور في هذا المجال . وبعد الثورة الإسلامية أخذ المنهج الأكاديمي المتبع في مراكز التعليم الديني والجامعات في التحول التدريجي . إذ رغمت التطورات المعاصرة في العلوم الحديثة وفي تقنيات الإتصال المعاهدﹶ المهتمة بالعلوم الإنسانية على أخذ السياق المعامر بعين الإعتبار . ولذا أخذت مراكز التعليم الشيعية التقليدية، التي ظلت إلى ما قبل خمسين سنة لا ﺗﺪﺭﹼﺱ إلا الفقه، ﺗﻌﺘﻨﻲ اليوم بتدريس اللغات الأجنبية والعلوم القرآنية والتفسير، بما فيها الدراسات الغربية عن القرآن، وصار تعترف بقيمة معظم العلوم الإنسانية في الغرب .},

He described Nöldeke as a great scholar and his Geschichte des Qorâns as a valuable contribution. Al-Zanjānī's work also included an outline of Nöldeke's discussion on the order of the revelation of the suras. It is probably safe to say that al-Zanjānī's book is the first independent work on the history of the Qur'an by a Muslim scholar. This fact leads one to wonder about the apparent lack of previous interest in the historiography of the Qur'an among Islamic scholarship. The present paper seeks to address this question and offer an overview of historiographical scholarship on the Qur'an contributed by Muslim writers both before and following Nöldeke بعد خمسة وسبعين سنة تقريبا من ظهور كتاب نولدكه بعنوان (تاريخ القرآن) أشار العالم الايراني أبو عبد اللّه الزنجاني (1892—1941) إشارة سريعة في الفصل الأخير من كتابه إلى نسخة من كتاب نولدكه بتنقيح شوالي وبرجستراسر وبريتزل. وقال الزنجاني إن نولدكه باحث عظيم وإن كتابه إسهام قيّم. واشتمل كتاب الزنجاني على ملخص لما ذكره نولدكه عن ترتيب وحي السور في القرآن. ولعله من غير المجازفة أن نقول إن كتاب الزنجاني أول عمل مستقل لباحث مسلم عن تاريخ القرآن، وهذا يدفعنا إلى التساؤل عن القصور الواضح من قبل في الاهتمام بتاريخ القرآن اهتماما كافيا في الكتابات الاسلامية. ويهدف هذا المقال إلى النظر في هذه المسألة كما يقدم عرضا عاما لكتابات الباحثين المسلمين في تاريخ القرآن قبل نولدكه وبعده.},

First, the speech acts of the Prophet are analyzed using the categories put forward by John Searle to see how they function within the conversation.

Part I provides a quick introduction to R and presents the key features of FactoMineR and factoextra. Part II describes classical principal component methods to analyze data sets containing, predominantly, either continuous or categorical variables. These methods include: Principal Component Analysis (PCA, for continuous variables), simple correspondence analysis (CA, for large contingency tables formed by two categorical variables) and Multiple CA (MCA, for a data set with more than 2 categorical variables). In part III, you'll learn advanced methods for analyzing a data set containing a mix of variables (continuous and categorical) structured or not into groups: Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA). Part IV covers hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC), which is useful for performing clustering with a data set containing only categorical variables or with a mixed data of categorical and continuous variables.},

  abstract = {Highlights, scribbling, and marginal notes: Annotation is often a private practice that we only occasionally share with others, or even more rarely share publicly. Once considered fundamental to hypertext systems, the potential of annotating digital documents is often overlooked in today's technology. As data commonly leaves our devices when collaborating, further questions arise on digital ownership and privacy. In this thesis, I examine the question of how both ownership and privacy can be ensured in the context of Digital Humanities research, which increasingly leverages interoperable infrastructures and Linked Open Data. In an explorative study, I first investigate the aspects of real-time collaboration in research tools, followed by an examination of institutional services on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. By establishing interoperability between such networks and the web, I then propose two approaches for bridging those networks and strengthening privacy, ownership, and private collaboration following the paradigm of local-first software. I argue that by balancing the autonomy of peers and the determinism of the web, gateways can translate across the separation of both networks while supporting peers by providing archiving and data availability. This enables researchers to perform private and collaborative annotation, while the underlying data can be embedded into existing workflows due to the bridge between both systems. Future work concerns the viability of this approach in scholarly environments and further research on the usability of distributed systems in the academic context.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes are among the most horrible events of nature due to unexpected occurrence, for which no spiritual means are available for protection. The only way of preserving life and property is to prepare for the inevitable: applying earthquake-resistant construction methods. Zones of damaging earthquakes along the Silk Road are reviewed for seismic hazard and to understand the ways local civilizations coped with it during the past two thousand years. China and its wide sphere of cultural influence certainly had earthquake-resistant architectural practice, as the high number of ancient buildings, especially high pagodas, prove. A brief review of anti-seismic design and construction methods (applied both for wooden and masonry buildings) is given, in the context of earthquake-prone zones of Northern China. Muslim architects in Western China and Central Asia used brick and mortar to construct earthquake-resistant structural systems. Ancient Greek architects in Anatolia and the Aegean applied steel clamps embedded in lead casing to hold together columns and masonry walls during frequent earthquakes. Romans invented concrete and built all sizes of buildings as a single, non-flexible unit. Masonry, surrounding and decorating the concrete core of the wall, did not bear load. Concrete resisted minor shaking, yielding only to forces higher than fracture limits. Roman building traditions survived the Dark Ages, and 12th century Crusader castles erected in earthquake-prone Syria survive until today in reasonably good condition. Usage of earthquake-resistant technology depends on the perception of earthquake risks and on available financial resources. Earthquake-resistant construction practice is significantly more expensive than regular construction. Frequent earthquakes maintain safe construction practices, like the timber-laced masonry tradition in the Eastern Mediterranean throughout 500 years of political and technological development.},

SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).},

Teaching History in the Digital Age serves as a guide for practitioners on how to fruitfully employ the transformative changes of digital media in the research, writing, and teaching of history. T.

The Ghaznavids rulers followed the middle Abbasid practice of recruiting an army of Turkish ghilman and collecting taxes to pay them.

The building works of this ruler and his amirs transformed the fabric of the Mamluk capital, Cairo, and shaped its future development in decades to come. For most of al-Nasir Muhammads sultanate, Tankiz al-Nasiri ruled as governor of the Syrian province. Tankizs term was one of the longest for any amir to retain a single office and to remain in the good graces of this sultan, known for his mercurial nature. Tankiz played a critical role in Mamluk politics and Syrian history. His lengthy tenure also allowed him to give sustained attention to the built environment of the province. During his term, he undertook an ambitious program of construction that involved monuments, urban works and renewal projects. This book investigates Tankizs building program by identifying the works that he commissioned, exploring the nature of his participation in these works, and situating them within the broader contexts of architectural development in the region and patronage during the Mamluk period. The volume features over 80 photographs and other illustrations, including several in full color. It is fully indexed and provides a wealth of references to primary and secondary literature.},

From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard’s last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert’s secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors. Finally, we demonstrate that Guibert must have reworked the disputed visionary texts allegedly authored by Hildegard to such an extent that style-oriented computational procedures attribute the texts to Guibert.},

While this task has long been considered solved for modern languages such as English, there exist many (e.g. historic) languages for which the problem is harder to solve, due to a lack of resources and unstable orthography. Our approach is based on recent advances in the field of ‘deep’ representation learning, where neural networks have led to a dramatic increase in performance across several domains. The proposed system combines two approaches: on the one hand, we apply temporal convolutions to model the orthography of input words at the character level; secondly, we use distributional word embeddings to represent the lexical context surrounding the input words. We demonstrate how this system reaches state-of-the-art performance on a number of representative Middle Dutch data sets, even without corpus-specific parameter tuning.},

Although there was an earlier and substantial historiographical tradition, Ibn ʿAsākir's biography is distinct from those of his predecessors in two major ways. First, he strategically arranged his biography to emphasize or de-emphasize certain aspects of ʿUmar II's life, including his youth, rise to the caliphate, and reputation as a redeemer. Second, Ibn ʿAsākir's legitimizing historiography appears to be bi-directional. Namely, where earlier biographers depicted ʿUmar II as the “fifth of the Rāshidūn,” bolstering the later Umayyad's reputation through an association with earlier authorities, in Ibn ʿAsākir's account problematic aspects of the early civil wars and fitna-ridden Rāshidūn period are also elided through the Rāshidūn's association with the famously pious ʿUmar II. The context for this bi-directionality is to be found in the political and social environment in which Ibn ʿAsākir compiled his Tārīkh, where dual pressure from Crusader and Shiʿite opponents contributed to his articulation of a particular Sunni vision of political and religious continuity that relied heavily on ‘Umar II's unique persona.},

While never universally accepted by all later Sunnī scholars as necessarily connoting unassailable personal integrity, the notion of ʿadāla was nevertheless emphasized in an enormous range of Sunnī theological and ḥadīth works and especially in Companionate biographical compilations throughout the Middle Ages. From the mid-fifth century AH onward, Sunnī biographers reinterpreted the collective probity and uprightness of the Companions in biographical compilations; works which expanded in both scope and content to become an integral aspect of competing articulations of community and authority in the sectarian atmosphere of the later Middle Ages.},

  abstract = {Rather than a handbook or chronological history of secretaries and viziers, or a straightforward guide to administrative terminology, the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb by Muḥammad b. al-ʿAbdūs al-Ǧahšiyārī (d. 331/942) is a collection of ʿAbbāsid-era narratives on the history of early Islamic administration. Related to other works in the genre adab al-kātib, the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb provides insight into one compiler's literary techniques as well as his social/cultural agenda. The portion of al-Ǧahšiyārī's work analyzed here focuses on key events in the Umayyad period and illustrates his apologetic stance on the non-Muslim foundations of ʿAbbāsid administrative structures especially well. Using short anecdotes that contain pithy, repetitive tropes of non-Muslim administrative officials' arrogance or incompetence, al-Ǧahšiyārī polemically mythologized a foundations narrative for early Islamic administrative history. Several studies of another portion of this text, on the ʿAbbāsid caliphs and the Barmakids, have determined the literary/historical value of al-Ǧahšiyārī's work. In these brief comments, four short anecdotes from a relatively understudied portion of the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb are assessed in order to demonstrate al-Ǧahšiyārī's mode of representation for the earliest stages of Islamic administration. Plutôt qu'un manuel ou une histoire chronologique des bureaucrates et des vizirs ou un simple guide d'initiation à la terminologie administrative, le Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb de Muhammad b. al-ʿAbdūs al-Ǧahšiyārī (d. 331/942) est une collection de récits de l'époque abbasside sur la genèse de l'administration islamique. Lié à d'autres œuvres du genre adab al-kātib, le Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb met en lumière certaines techniques littéraires du compilateur ainsi que ses préoccupations socio-culturelles. L'extrait de l'œuvre d'al-Ǧahšiyārī que nous analysons dans cet article met l'accent sur les événements marquants de la période omeyyade et illustre particulièrement bien sa position apologétique sur les fondations non musulmanes des structures administratives abbasides. En utilisant de courtes anecdotes qui contiennent des tropes répétitives et concises de l'arrogance ou de l'incompétence des responsables administratifs non-musulmans, al-Ǧahšiyārī mythologise de façon polémique un récit des fondations du début de l'histoire administrative islamique. Plusieurs études d'un autre extrait de ce même texte, centrées sur les califes abbassides et les Barmécides, ont déterminé la valeur littéraire et historique de l'œuvre d'al-Ǧahšiyārī. Dans les brefs commentaires qui suivent, quatre courtes anecdotes d'une portion relativement peu étudiée du Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb sont évaluées afin de démontrer le mode de représentation des premières étapes de l'administration islamique par al-Ǧahšiyārī.},

Such economists, belonging to the original (old) institutional economics and the historical school maintain that the constraint function is riddled with inefficient technologies and institutions which agents fail to replace with superior ones even when the switching cost is clearly lower than expected benefit. The argument ultimately rests on a theory of action á la Herbert Simon—where agents become habituated for whatever is the default institution. Such a theory recognizes that agents are ready to replace habits with more viable ones—but only when agents face shocks or crises. Such recognition, though, necessarily allows rational choice, in the sense of responsiveness to incentives, to enter from the rear window: after all, shocks and crises are merely severe incentives.},

It has been stated that Miskawaih belonged to the second group of historians and his concept of history, which he outlined in his voluminous historical work Tajārib al-Umam, was astonishingly modern. The conclusion drawn is that Miskawaih occupies a unique place among the Arabic historians. He belongs to the group of courtiers and secretaries. Even in his own group he possesses a marked individuality and his history has many distinctive features. Although a Persian, he was a remarkable representative of the Arabic culture of his age. He had something to offer to Arabic historiography in the way of political thinking about history and interest in statecraft and civil administration. Miskawaih was the first Arabic historian with a definite concept of history and he applied this to the writing of the history of his own time. This was his personal contribution to Arabic historiography.},

We examine the existing theoretical and conceptual models on the relations between space and emotions and illustrate how scholars need to bring together narratives, materiality, and practices in order to understand the entanglement of space and emotions. Through four different but connected historical examples: Mughal imperial Delhi, princely Rampur, small towns milieux in colonial India and the Lyari neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, we trace the shifting configurations of power, emotions, and social space of “Muslim locales” in South Asia. On this particular terrain, we also want to specify the nature of change in emotional experiences as Muslim locales transformed from elite enclaves into locales of disempowerment in the transition to national independence. We examine the shifting discourses and practices in the built environment, in the landscapes portrayed in visual and literary reconstructions, and in the lived everyday spatial practices and experiences in South Asia. While providing a historical narrative, these articles also present new possibilities to explore affective archives and interdisciplinary approaches for writing a history of emotions.},

Such concerns are often driven by material and cultural struggles for power. Thus, discourses around education for girls and women are sites for the construction not only of gender identity but also of class, religion, and the nation"--Provided by publisher},

However, text analysis of these documents has rarely been done mainly due to the lack of natural language processing tools that can handle pre-modern Japanese. In this article, we propose a method to extract and visualize the relationships among persons from Japanese historical documents with an aid of supplementary information such as personal name and place name indices. The goal of the method is to extract dynamics of relationships among historical persons. The method utilizes locational information to obtain latent relationships among persons based on their spatial activities. The proposed method is applied to a Japanese historical chronicle written in the 12th century. Experimental results showed a strong correspondence to the known historical facts, and the results of a user survey completed by researchers of Japanese history demonstrated some potential for the method to serve as a new approach in the fields of humanities.},

It focuses on fear and insecurity as emotional practices that structure the spatial and social relations in the city. Using the narratives of young Baloch men who must negotiate the threat of violence at the hands of criminal gangs and state security forces within their area and rival political parties outside the area, the article highlights how fear and insecurity must be understood as being contextually situated, depending on one’s social and geographical position within the city. The experiences of these young men demonstrate how emotions such as fear and insecurity are both produced by and reproduce spatial configurations of power.},

  abstract = {Extreme Inscription” attempts to articulate the grammatological primitives of the hard drive, the inscription technology that has had the single greatest impact on computing in the latter half of the 20th century. Rather than offer up yet another generalized account of electronic textuality, my objective in this essay is to examine one specific writing machine in its unique social, technical, and imaginative milieu. Random access disk storage, I argue, is the technology that embodies the “database paradigm” a critic such as Lev Manovich sees as fundamental to new media. The history of hard drive technology is treated in the essay, as is the cultural impact of new hard drive-based technologies like iPod, TiVo, and Gmail’s massive multi-gigabyte quotas. Ultimately the article seeks to establish a place for the often invisible and certainly unglamorous presence of storage technologies amid the largely visual and screen-based approaches that currently prevail in new media theory.},

During the period of the pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology, some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous interviews conducted by the author, Track Changes is the first literary history of word processing. Matthew Kirschenbaum examines how the interests and ideals of creative authorship came to coexist with the computer revolution. Who were the first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they share? Was word processing perceived as just a better typewriter or something more? How did it change our understanding of writing? Track Changes balances the stories of individual writers with a consideration of how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always grounded in particular instruments and media, from quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover the candidates for the first novel written on a word processor, explore the surprisingly varied reasons why writers of both popular and serious literature adopted the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and consider the fate of literary scholarship and memory in an era when the final remnants of authorship may consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the cloud."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.},

We propose that topic modeling, when conceived as a process of thematic exploration, can provide a new entry point into this process. To this end, we present research on a new software tool called TOME: Interactive TOpic Model and MEtadata Visualization, designed to support the exploratory thematic analysis of digitized archival collections. TOME is centered around a set of visualizations intended to facilitate the interpretation of the topic model and its incorporation into extant humanities research practices. In contrast to other topic model browsers, which present the model on its own terms, ours is informed by the process of conducting early-stage humanities research. Our article thus also demonstrates the conceptual conversions—in terms of both design and process—that interdisciplinary collaboration necessarily entails. In making these conversions explicit, and exploring the implications of their successes and failures, we take up the call, as voiced by Johanna Drucker (Humanities approaches to graphical display. Digital Humanities Quarterly, 5(1), 2011), to resist the ‘intellectual Trojan horse’ of visualization. We seek to model a new mode of interdisciplinary inquiry, one that brings the methodological emphasis of the digital humanities to bear on the practices of humanities research and computer science alike.},

Fields represented include computer science, information systems, management, journalism, psychology, law, library science, and sociology. This volume introduces some of the major controversies surrounding the computerization of society and helps readers recognize the social processes that drive and shape computerization. Division into eight provocatively titled sections facilitates course planning for classroom or seminar use. A lead article for each section frames the major controversies, locates the selections within the debates, and points to other relevant literature. Key Features • A fully revised and updated version of the first anthological treatment of the subject • Organized to facilitate course planning for classroom or seminar use • Provides coverage of the influence of computers on a wide variety of fields including computer science, information systems, management, journalism, psychology, law, library science, and sociology • Includes discussion of the following issues related to computerization: • Does computerization demonstrably improve the productivity of organizations? • Should computer systems be designed to empower workers? • Does electronic mail facilitate the formation of new communities, or does it undermine intimate interaction? • Is computerization likely to reduce privacy and personal freedom?},

To evaluate effects of presentation mode, pupil dilation was measured in three tasks spanning a range of cognitive activities: mental multiplication, digit sequence recall, and vigilance. Stimuli were presented both aurally and visually, controlling for all known visual influences on pupil diameter. The patterns of dilation were similar for both aural and visual presentation for all three tasks, but the magnitudes of pupil response were greater for aural presentation. Accuracy was higher for visual presentation for mental arithmetic and digit recall. The findings can be accounted for in terms of dual codes in working memory and suggest that cognitive load is lower for visual than for aural presentation.},

In this perspective, a vector-space representation can be generated for each author or disputed text according to words and their nearby context. To determine the authorship of a disputed text, the cosine similarity between vector representations can be applied. The proposed strategies can be adapted without any difficulty to different languages (such as English and Italian) or genres (essays, political speeches, and newspaper articles). Evaluations using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs))and based on four test collections (the Federalist Papers, the State of the Union addresses, the Glasgow Herald, and La Stampa newspapers) indicate that the distributed language representation preforms well, providing sometimes better effectiveness than state-of-the-art methods such as k-NN, nearest shrunken centroids, chi-square, Delta, latent Dirichlet allocation, or multi-layer perceptron classifier.},

  abstract = {The name (Meletē)ToPān v.0.3 is based on the Greek principle μελέτη τὸ πᾶν which roughly translate to "take into care everything". I decided for the name because Topic-Modelling performs well on large amounts of logically structured chunks of texts and it helps selecting the interesting bits in a large corpus of text by technically having looked at everything. The butterfly in the logo is of the species Melete. The original photograph is by Didier Descouens and he has licensed it under CC BY-SA 4.0. I changed the image for the logo slightly. I'd strongly suggest to start with the original if you want to use it, but you can also use this now slightly modified logo under CC BY-SA 4.0 license as I am required to share it under the same license as the original image. ToPān is Topic-Modelling for everyone: from people without programming knowledge to people that want to build teaching and text-reuse tools and apps based on Topic-Modelling data without having to develop their own tool or having to majorly restructure their textual data. ToPān is made to be shared and used. That is why I tried to modularise ToPān in a way that in each step you could ingest your own data. It works best however, if you work your way from left to right: from "Data Input" to "LDA Tables" (please find more details under "Instructions"). ToPān works best with files that are structured according to the CTS/CITE architecture. ToPān is also still under active development. This is an alpha release. More features will be added and you are encouraged to roadtest ToPān and send me feedback or report bugs. Technical Note: ToPān is written in RShiny and uses the following R-libraries: shiny, RCurl (also I mainly switch to httr, because of RCurl's mysterious errors and performance issues when sending lots and lots of requests), XML (but also install XML2), httr (and curl), lda, LDAvis. If you want to install a local version of ToPān, simply clone the repo, install R, RStudio, and the mentioned libraries and Bob's your uncle.},

Our goal is to make a comparison between the two genres concerning the importance of physical appearance of characters. In this article, as a first step in researching this topic, we consider the task of identifying sentences that contain descriptions of a character’s physical appearance in a set of novels in both genres. We manually annotate sentences where the appearance of a character is described. We then apply a machine learning methodology and manually written lexical–syntactic queries to automate the extraction of these sentences. Contrary to our expectations, the queries outperform the classifier. When we use a combination of the two automated methods, the extraction of physical descriptions from chick lit is more successful. This suggests that such descriptions are more uniform in character.},

We show that for this purpose, second-order document similarity measures taken from the authorship verification literature strongly outperform standard document similarity measures commonly used for outlier identification. We apply these improved methods to two famous corpora suspected of including pseudepigrapha: Shakespeare’s plays and Pauline epistles.},

This article presents a method of quantifying spelling variation as a linguistic variable whose relation with relevant grammatical and contextual variables can be statistically measured. Based on the normalization of the non-standard word forms and the subsequent calculation of edit distance between the normalized and attested word forms, the method is applicable to morphologically tagged historical text corpora and is here tested on an early medieval documentary Latin corpus with notable spelling variation. To justify the proposed method, several methodological issues of both philological and technical nature are discussed. The latter part of the article illustrates the potential of the method by way of a case study on the relationship between spelling variation and the use of non-standard prepositions in documentary Latin and by examining the chronological variation of spelling in its historical context. There appears to be a statistically significant dependence between non-standard spelling and the use of non-standard prepositions. It is also argued that the diachronic spelling distribution may be indicative of a spelling reform, in addition to reflecting an already known administrative change relative to scribal practices. Thus, the proposed method of quantifying spelling variation proves to offer interesting insights into the linguistic and historical reality underlying the text corpus.},

Situating the writing of English literary history within the context of the cultural market, print culture, and nationalism, I argue that the mid-century model of literary history both represents the dialectical outcome of previous decades of thinking through the problem of cultural change and puts in place the terms for the modern narrative of the literary canon. An earlier aesthetics of gendered and sociable refinement separated itself from a Gothic past later recovered as the singular moment of literary achievement. The Gothic account was then challenged by a rethinking of consumption as reading abstracted over time. Together, Gothic historicism and abstract reading formed the antithetical basis on which critics established the modern canonical account of English literary history.},

The basis of this investigation is represented by CorpusTracer, a database that stores the required data in a suitable format and with the required level of expressivity. In this article, we present the design of our database and our data model based on CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo. We discuss the implementation and suitability of the conceptual and technical realization for our research question. We conclude that FRBRoo fits well to the task at hand. We found that the comparatively complex data structure it requires can be sufficiently abstracted through current implementation methods. As the research continues, our data model will have to grow and we expect that the presented methods will be sufficient to accommodate our future requirements.},

The paper addresses a number of issues involved in the process of digitalising manuscripts included in the two existing editions (Ciasca 1888 and Marmardji 1935), adding variants in unedited manuscripts, encoding and lemmatising the text. Issues involved in the design of the ADP include presentation of variants, choice of the standard text, applicability of TEI guidelines, automatic translation between different encodings, cross-edition concordances and principles of lemmatisation.},

  abstract = {The start of the twenty-first century has brought with it a rich variety of ways in which readers can connect with one another, access texts, and make sense of what they are reading. At the same time, new technologies have also opened up exciting possibilities for scholars of reading and reception in offering them unprecedented amounts of data on reading practices, book buying patterns, and book collecting habits.In From Codex to Hypertext, scholars from multiple disciplines engage with both of these strands. This volume includes essays that consider how changes such as the mounting ubiquity of digital technology and the globalization of structures of publication and book distribution are shaping the way readers participate in the encoding and decoding of textual meaning. Contributors also examine how and why reading communities cohere in a range of contexts, including prisons, book clubs, networks of zinesters, state-funded programs designed to promote active citizenship, and online spaces devoted to sharing one's tastes in books.As concerns circulate in the media about the ways that reading -- for so long anchored in print culture and the codex -- is at risk of being irrevocably altered by technological shifts, this book insists on the importance of tracing the historical continuities that emerge between these reading practices and those of previous eras.In addition to the volume editor, contributors include Daniel Allington, Bethan Benwell, Jin Feng, Ed Finn, Danielle Fuller, David S. Miall, Julian Pinder, Janice Radway, Julie Rak, DeNel Rehberg Sedo, Megan Sweeney, Joan Bessman Taylor, Molly Abel Travis, and David Wright.},

The story focuses on the organization of families and tribes, religious groups and states, depicts them in their varied and changing contexts, and shows how they were transformed by their interactions with other religious and political communities into a varied, global and interconnected family of societies. The book concludes with the European commercial and imperial interventions that initiated a new set of transformations in the Islamic world, and the onset of the modern era. Organized in narrative sections for the history of each major region, with innovative, analytic summary introductions and conclusions, this book is a unique endeavor. Its breadth, clarity, style, and thoughtful exposition will ensure its place in the classroom and beyond as a guide for the educated reader"--},

Unlike many authors of similar surveys, Lassner and Bonner not only emphasize historical trends, but show readers how difficult it is to fashion a coherent historical narrative out of the complex and often contradictory primary sources. Readers thus participate in the intricate process by which professional historians attempt to reconstruct the past. At the same time, since classical Islamic civilization is so important for Muslims in the present-day Near East, this book will help the reader understand the contemporary Islamic world."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {LaTeX ( LAH-tekh or  LAY-tekh) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX. LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language. LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.Like TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies. LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as LaTeX2ε). LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).},

  abstract = {"Preface About this book Two common types of user interfaces in statistical computing are the command line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI). The usual CLI consists of a textual console in which the user types a sequence of commands at a prompt, and the output of the commands is printed to the console as text. The R console is an example of a CLI. A GUI is the primary means of interacting with desktop environments, such as Windows and Mac OS X, and statistical software, such as JMP. GUIs are contained within windows, and resources, such as documents, are represented by graphical icons. User controls are packed into hierarchical drop-down menus, buttons, sliders, etc. The user manipulates the windows, icons, and menus with a pointer device, such as a mouse. The R language, like its predecessor S, is designed for interactive use through a command line interface (CLI), and the CLI remains the primary interface to R. However, the graphical user interface (GUI) has emerged as an effective alternative, depending on the specific task and the target audience. With respect to GUIs, we see R users falling into three main target audiences: those who are familiar with programming R, those who are still learning how to program, and those who have no interest in programming. On some platforms, such as Windows and Mac OS X, R has graphical front-ends that provide a CLI through a text console control. Similar examples include the multi-platform RStudioTM IDE, the Java-based JGR and the RKWard GUI for the Linux KDE desktop. Although these interfaces are GUIs, they are still very much in essence CLIs, in that the primary mode of interacting with R is the same. Thus, these GUIs appeal mostly to those who are comfortable with R programming"--},

The group presented with visual text and a diagram rather than audio text and a diagram was superior, reversing most previous data on the modality effect. It was hypothesized that the reason for the reversal was that the transitory auditory text component was too long to be processed easily in working memory compared to more permanent written information. Experiment 2 (N = 64) replicated the experiment with the variation of a reduced length of both auditory and visual text instructions. Results indicated a reinstatement of the modality effect with audio/visual instructions proving superior to visual only instructions. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Sometimes the bibles are regarded as offering a corrupted view of the truth about the prophets and sometimes a less complete picture of them, which would explain the differences that are easy to detect.

The Arab idol worshippers were polytheists, but they also believed in a High God called Allah whose house was in the Kaba and who had supremacy over their tribal deities. In Medina, which was in many ways different from Mecca, idols were associated with various levels of the tribal organization. The Byzantines and Sasanians conducted their Arabian affairs through their respective Arab buffer kingdoms, Ghassan and al-Hira. Caravan trade was often behind the cooperation between certain nomadic tribes and the Sasanians. In addition to trade, the entrepreneurial Qurashis invested in agriculture. Since conditions in Mecca itself were uninviting for agriculture, they looked for opportunities elsewhere.},

This article places this phenomenon within the larger framework of Bedouin self-representation and explores the nature and specific uses of the complex and polysemic notion of nasab in treatises and speech. The ambiguity resulting from a tension between the pragmatic context of local articulation and circumstantial (re-)definition and the ideological significance, purportedly unchangeable and defined character and moral value of nasab is reflected in historical and modern discourses as well as in pervasive references to tribal groups as being defined by nasab. The particular concomitance of practical and ideological aspects is the reason for the lasting impact of this notion, as its structure allows for the negotiation of both political issues and individual and collective identities. The publications considered here, mostly from Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, vary between an affirmative stance that often seeks to define prestigious lineages and an attempt to balance the obvious uncertainties of the data with an interest in establishing the identity of tribal groups and narratives referring to descent. As Bedouin lore puts it, the concept of belonging defined by origins in terms of agnatic descent (nasab) is challenged, and sometimes superseded, by the affinity established through locality and cohabitation.},

  abstract = {The question of translators’ stylistic visibility in translated texts has been a recurring theme in translation studies. Recently, the employment of state-of-the-art stylometric methods such as multivariate statistical analysis or machine learning techniques has enabled important progress to be made in exploring the problem. Nevertheless, studies are conflicting in their findings. Some find evidence of translators’ stylistic presence, while others fail to do so. The lack of agreement in the literature makes one suspect some contextual factors affecting the degree of translators’ visibility. The present study focuses on one such possible factor—language combinations involved in translation. It is hypothesized that the farther the two languages involved are structurally apart, the more likely it is for the translator’s style to gain visibility as the increased distance will allow the translator greater freedom to be creative with his or her choices. The present study applies bootstrap consensus tree analysis and consensus network analysis to 175 samples of contemporary literary translation in two language pairs—the intimate pair of French and English and the distant pair of Korean and English. The analysis supports the hypothesis by showing that the authors completely override their translators to claim authorship in the French group, while authorial presence is significantly diminished in the Korean group, resulting in greater visibility for some translators.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that different parts of a classical Chinese poem vary in syntactic properties. The middle part is usually parallel, i.e. the two lines in a couplet have similar sentence structure and part of speech; in contrast, the beginning and final parts tend to be non-parallel. Imagistic language, dominated by noun phrases evoking images, is concentrated in the middle; propositional language, with more complex grammatical structures, is more often found at the end. We present the first quantitative analysis on these linguistic phenomena—syntactic parallelism, imagistic language, and propositional language—on a treebank of selected poems from the Complete Tang Poems. Written during the Tang Dynasty between the 7th and 9th centuries CE, these poems are often considered the pinnacle of classical Chinese poetry. Our analysis affirms the traditional observation that the final couplet is rarely parallel; the middle couplets are more frequently parallel, especially at the phrase rather than the word level. Further, the final couplet more often takes a non-declarative mood, uses function words, and adopts propositional language. In contrast, the beginning and middle couplets employ more content words and tend toward imagistic language.},

Byzantium had made diplomatic contact with Central Asian Turks as early as the sixth century CE and later the movement of Turkic peoples across the steppes north of the Black Sea brought them to the empire's borders in eastern Europe. Byzantine defences in Anatolia were clearly ineffective, partly a result of almost continuous civil strife in Byzantium between the bureaucratic and military parties since the death of the emperor Basil II in 1025 CE. In 1068 CE the general Romanus Diogenes became emperor and, in a series of military expeditions, attempted to put an end to the growing Turkish danger. The Ottomans crystallised in the far northwestern corner of Anatolia around Sögüd at the end of the seventh/thirteenth century. By the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century, the Saljuq sultanate had vanished.},

It begins with an exploration of the boundaries, functions and possible deployment of interpersonal networks formulated in the terminology of common tribal affiliation during that period, building on the author’s prosopographical study of the Arabic tribe (qabīla) of Kinda during the first three generations of Islamic history. It then considers the perspective of tribally founded elites, demonstrating and addressing their mainly local areas of authority as compared to administrative structures founded on visions of centralized power. In its last part, this paper moves from a longue durée comparison of the trajectories of families of different Kinda-affiliated tribal notables towards an assessment of the sources of authority at the disposal of a tribally-based leader, especially one in conflict with the central powers. On these three levels, this paper aims to determine the amount of independence available to tribal elites negotiating multiple roles. These roles included those of loyal provincial administrators, equal peers of global rulers and rebels contesting the legitimacy of the early Islamic Empire’s ruling elites on a potentially apocalyptic scale.},

In the wake of the Mongol invasion of Syria, an influx of civilian and military refugees poured into Egypt. Fugitives from the defeated Ayyūbid armies, and Turcomans and Kurds who had arrived in Syria earlier in flight from the Mongols, all joined the Mamlūk army. Barqūq's seizure of power in 784/1382 symbolises the restoration of the nondynastic Mamlūk sultanate, and the move from a Turkish to a Circassian sultanate. Mamlūks of Circassian origin formed the majority in the army and the sultans were drawn from their numbers.},

Alexandria was the main Mediterranean port and Fusṭāṭ was the capital city and the administrative and commercial centre. The survival of some Arabic-Christian historical works dealing with the Fāṭimid- Ayyūbid period adds significantly to Arabic-Muslim historiography. The period of Fāṭimid rule in Egypt can be divided into two distinctive phases: before and after the civil war of the 450s/1060s and the early 460s/1070s which also marked a transition from civilian to military rule. The Fāṭimid army of the sixth/twelfth century was a large force composed of cavalry and tens of thousands of black infantry and was scorned by the Franks for its poor fighting capabilities.},

Countless goods have been transported along the Eurasian trade routes. Spices, including especially pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and mace, represent the most obvious examples. The rise of European commercial activities in the Indian Ocean appears to have actually spurred a corresponding increase in the overland caravan trade. In the first decades of the eighteenth century, the Mughal dynasty declined, and following Nadir Shah's invasion, the north Indian economy was under severe stress; however, economic growth was witnessed elsewhere, especially Iran. In 1750, new regional market was opened in the Russian city of Troitsk, at which prices were listed in both rubles and rupees.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that Ibn-Hawqal crossed the Sahara and visited Awdaghost in 951/2 to be the first Arab geographer who reached the gates of bilad al-Sudan. This is inferred from what he says about a cheque he saw in Awdaghost. A critical analysis of the references to this cheque suggests that it was a bill of debt owed by a trader from Sijilmasa resident at Awdaghost to another trader from Sijilmasa. The transactions between the two were part of the trans- Saharan trade, with one partner resident at Awdaghost and the other at Sijilmasa. The bill must have been held by the creditor, whom Ibn-Hawqal could have met at Sijilmasa. It was from this man that Ibn-Hawqal recorded the information about the ruler of the Sanhaja in the southern Sahara, and probably also about his relations with Ghana and other Sudanese polities. Another valuable piece of information, about the abandoned route from Ghana to Egypt, was collected in the oases of Egypt. Also, the detailed list of Berber tribes inhabiting the area between Tadmekka and Air could have been obtained in North Africa, rather than at Awdaghost, because communications in the Sahara were more frequent between north and south than between west and east. Ibn-Hawqal's description of the Sahara is stereotypic and adds nothing to what earlier geographers had to say, and the same applies to his words concerning Awdaghost itself. Towns and kingdoms in the Sudan mentioned by Ibn-Hawqal had already been recorded earlier by al-Ya'qubi, Ibn al-Faqih and al-Mas'udi. For a traveller who crossed the Sahara, Ibn-Hawqal's information is rather poor, but if he collected his information north of the Sahara, as this paper suggests, his labours as an inquisitive geographer are praiseworthy.},

  abstract = {The Bible's grand narrative about Israel's Exodus from Egypt is central to Biblical religion, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim identity and the formation of the academic disciplines studying the ancient Near East. It has also been a pervasive theme in artistic and popular imagination. Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective is a pioneering work surveying this tradition in unprecedented breadth, combining archaeological discovery, quantitative methodology and close literary reading. Archaeologists, Egyptologists, Biblical Scholars, Computer Scientists, Geoscientists and other experts contribute their diverse approaches in a novel, transdisciplinary consideration of ancient topography, Egyptian and Near Eastern parallels to the Exodus story, the historicity of the Exodus, the interface of the Exodus question with archaeological fieldwork on emergent Israel, the formation of biblical literature, and the cultural memory of the Exodus in ancient Israel and beyond.This edited volume contains research presented at the groundbreaking symposium "Out of Egypt: Israel’s Exodus Between Text and Memory, History and Imagination" held in 2013 at the Qualcomm Institute of the University of California, San Diego. The combination of 44 contributions by an international group of scholars from diverse disciplines makes this the first such transdisciplinary study of ancient text and history. In the original conference and with this new volume, revolutionary media, such as a 3D immersive virtual reality environment, impart innovative, Exodus-based research to a wider audience. Out of archaeology, ancient texts, science and technology emerge an up-to-date picture of the Exodus for the 21st Century and a new standard for collaborative research.},

Although much has been written about the status of non-Muslims in the Islamic empire, no previous works have examined how the rules applying to minorities were formulated. Milka Levy-Rubin's remarkable book traces the emergence of these regulations from the first surrender agreements in the immediate aftermath of conquest to the formation of the canonic document called the Pact of Ụmar, which was formalized under the early Ạbbasids, in the first half of the ninth century. What the study reveals is that the conquered peoples themselves played a major role in the creation of these policies, and that these were based on long-standing traditions, customs, and institutions from earlier pre-Islamic cultures that originated in the worlds of both the conquerors and the conquered. In its connections to Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian traditions, the book will appeal to historians of Europe as well as Arabia and Persia"--Provided by publisher},

Drawing upon a range of under-explored primary sources, this article argues that the autobiography was never written as a traditional ex post facto memoir. Only by recognizing its fictionalized nature and by exploring the boundaries between biography and fiction, can al-Bannā’s memoirs can be properly understood.Keywords: Islamism, Egypt, Ḥasan al-Bannā, The Muslim Brothers, Biography, Autobiography},

As noted by Kilgarriff (Language is never, ever, ever, random, Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory , 2005; 1(2): 263–76.), the use of the χ 2 and log-likelihood ratio tests is problematic in this context, as they are based on the assumption that all samples are statistically independent of each other. However, words within a text are not independent. As pointed out in Kilgarriff (Comparing corpora, International Journal of Corpus Linguistics , 2001; 6(1): 1–37) and Paquot and Bestgen (Distinctive words in academic writing: a comparison of three statistical tests for keyword extraction. In Jucker, A., Schreier, D., and Hundt, M. (eds), Corpora: Pragmatics and Discourse . Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009, pp. 247–69), it is possible to represent the data differently and employ other tests, such that we assume independence at the level of texts rather than individual words. This allows us to account for the distribution of words within a corpus. In this article we compare the significance estimates of various statistical tests in a controlled resampling experiment and in a practical setting, studying differences between texts produced by male and female fiction writers in the British National Corpus. We find that the choice of the test, and hence data representation, matters. We conclude that significance testing can be used to find consequential differences between corpora, but that assuming independence between all words may lead to overestimating the significance of the observed differences, especially for poorly dispersed words. We recommend the use of the t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or bootstrap test for comparing word frequencies across corpora.},

Three periods are distinguished: the Nairian-Urartian stretching from about 1200 bce to the conquest of the Armenian plateau by the Achaemenids; followed by the Zoroastrian phase, in which political, religious, social, and cultural institutions in Armenia were closely related to Iranian ones, lasting until the adoption of Christianity as state religion in Armenia at the beginning of the fourth century. This heralds the third and last phase considered in this contribution, concluding with the cornerstone of Armenian identity formation in the direction given to Armenia and its Church by Yovhannēs Ōjnec\&apos;i (John of Odzun, d. 728), who opted for a moderate form of Miaphysitism after the rejection of the Council of Chalcedon. The developments in each of the three periods are measured against the criteria Smith considered central for the presence of an \emph{ethnie}, while attention is given to the Iranian aspects of Armenian society, the presence of a Hellenistic strand in its culture, and its western turn upon the adoption of Christianity.},

What is the relation between the new historicist anecdote and the database field, Liu asks, and can either have a critical function in the age of postmodern historicism? Local Transcendence includes two previously unpublished essays and a synthetic introduction in which Liu traverses from his earlier work on the theory of historicism to his recent studies of information culture to propose a theory of contingent method incorporating a special inflection of history: media history.},

Our basic assumption is the following: such texts include complex multilevel structures (i.e. those calling upon lexis, semantics, morphology, syntax, etc) which function as heterogeneity indicators (progression to a new episode, focalization on a new point of view, insertion of reported speech, etc.). Additionally, the recurrence of these structures is a factor in textual cohesion. Under certain conditions, they function as topological ‘motifs’, marking the linear progression of the text and ensuring textual unity. We are developing new methods to detect and analyse the distributions of such ‘motifs’ and to support structural comparisons with the objective of contrastive corpus studies (contrasts between genres, authorial styles, etc.). Our methods are based on mathematical models (neighbourhoods, bursts) and combine a qualitative approach with a sequential quantitative analysis to comprehend language in a linear fashion.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to identify types of landowners in Lower Iraq, where land was a social, political and economic issue, especially during the 8th century. The focus on landholders determines the characterisation of the imperial as well as regional Lower Iraqi elite. It takes into consideration Jewish and Christian landowners (for example, ecclesiastical landed elites in the Nestorian community), Persian landowners (for example, the dahāqīn who settled in the region before the Islamic conquest) and the landed Islamic elites (who are related to the conquering group). With this typology, I shed light not only on the diversity of landed elites in Lower Iraq but also on the subgroup of Islamic landowners. Defining landowner groups is a prerequisite to the study of the interplay between local and imperial elites over the course of the 8th century. This period is regarded as that of the rise of Islamic elites. Researchers agree these elites were no longer specifically bound to military functions, a development with consequences for other landed groups. Subsequent interplays took place in the context of inter- and intra-group relationships. This paper seeks to offer a typology of these interactions in order to understand the relationships and power ratios at stake.},

  abstract = {Accurately determining who wrote a manuscript has captivated scholars of literary history for centuries, as the true author can have important ramifications in religion, law, literary studies, philosophy, and education. A wide array of lexical, character, syntactic, semantic, and application-specific features have been proposed to represent a text so that authorship attribution can be established automatically. Although surface-level features have been tested extensively, few studies have systematically explored high-level features, in part due to limitations in the natural language processing techniques required to capture high-level features. However, high-level features, such as sentence structure, are used subconsciously by a writer and thus may be more consistent than surface-level features, such as word choice. In this article, we introduce a new high-level feature based on local syntactic dependencies that an author uses when referring to a named entity (in our case a person’s name). The series of experiments in the contexts of movie reviews reveal how the amount of data in both the training and test sets influences predictive performance. Finally, we measure authorship consistency with respect to this new feature and show how consistency influences predictive performance. These results provide other researchers with a new model for how to evaluate new features and suggest that the local syntactic dependencies warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {During the Final Bronze Age (around 3750/3700 BP), the proto-urban sedentary cultural entity in southern Central Asia—known as the Oxus civilization or Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex—underwent major social transformations in different field aspects leading to a deep cultural change in the middle of the 4th millennium BP. Among the different reasons suggested to explain these sociocultural changes, the hypothesis of global climate change in Central Asia at the beginning of the 4th millennium BP has been emphasized by different scholars. In this paper, I will examine current paleo-environmental data in relation with the climate evolution during the Mid- and Late Holocene. A critical assessment of the hypothesis of climatic change in Central Asia at the beginning of the 4th millennium BP allows to stimulate the discussion anew. I argue that the present data do not support a drastic climate change during the first half of the 4th millennium BP as a responsible factor for the fall of the Oxus civilization, although local environmental modifications should also not be underestimated and further investigated in a more integrated perspective of co-evolution of the ecological environment and the human societies.},

It documents the internal dynamics of a trade network system based on a case study of 'Berber' traders from the Wād Nūn region, who specialized in outfitting camel caravans in the nineteenth century. Through an examination of contracts, correspondence, fatwas and interviews with retired caravaners, Professor Lydon shows how traders used their literacy skills in Arabic and how they had recourse to experts of Islamic law to regulate their long-distance transactions. The book also examines the strategies devised by women to participate in caravan trade. By embracing a continental approach, this study bridges the divide between West African and North African studies. The work will be of interest to historians of Africa, the Middle East, and the world and to scholars of long-distance trade, Muslim societies and Islamic law.},

Even among the nomads there seems to have been almost universal literacy in some regions. The scores of thousands of inscriptions and graffiti they left paint a vivid picture of the way-of-life, social systems, and personal emotions of their authors, information which is not available for any other non-élite population in the ancient Near East outside Egypt. This abundance of inscriptions has enabled Michael Macdonald to explore in detail some of the - often surprising - ways in which reading and writing were used in the literate and non-literate communities of ancient Arabia. He describes the many different languages and the distinct family of alphabets used in ancient Arabia, and discusses the connections between the use of particular languages or scripts and expressions of personal and communal identity. The problem of how ancient perceptions of ethnicity in this region can be identified in the sources is another theme of these papers; more specifically, they deal from several different perspectives with the question of what ancient writers meant when they applied the term 'Arab' to a wide variety of peoples throughout the ancient Near East.},

Four hypotheses exist: (a) invention during Han dynasty more than 2000 years ago, (b) transfer of technology from Persian Qanat’s more than 3000 years ago, (c) independent invention of local Uyghur people in the 15th century, and (d) late invention during the Chinese Qing dynasty (19th century). Our study dates, for the first time, 8 Karez systems by 14C from plants buried during the formation of Karez mounds, and interviews in order to record oral tradition. We found that the oldest investigated Karez systems originated in the Uyghurian Huihe dynasty (790–1755 AD), which coincides with the oral tradition. A second phase may have occurred during late Huihe/Qing dynasty (after 1755 AD), which may explain why information and the Uygurian term „Kan er jing“ went down in historic Chinese records. In conclusion, hypothesis (d) that oldest Karez systems were built during Qing dynasty has to be rejected because they are at least 600 years old. Instead, during the 3rd Chinese expansion in the 19th century AD the Karez system expanded and got maintenance. A review of regional palaeoclimatic proxies suggests that the origin and the maintenance of the Karez systems took place rather in more humid periods than in more arid ones. However, more research is needed on other Karez systems to test the pending hypotheses of a much older age.},

  abstract = {This kaleidoscopic book covers almost 3,000 years of Arab history and shines a light on the footloose Arab peoples and tribes who conquered lands and disseminated their language and culture over vast distances. Tracing this process to the origins of the Arabic language, rather than the advent of Islam, Tim Mackintosh-Smith begins his narrative more than a thousand years before Muhammad and focuses on how Arabic, both spoken and written, has functioned as a vital source of shared cultural identity over the millennia. Mackintosh-Smith reveals how linguistic developments-from pre-Islamic poetry to the growth of script, Muhammad's use of writing, and the later problems of printing Arabic-have helped and hindered the progress of Arab history, and investigates how, even in today's politically fractured post-Arab Spring environment, Arabic itself is still a source of unity and disunity},

  abstract = {D3.js can help you make data beautiful.D3 Tips and Tricks is a book written to help those who may be unfamiliar with JavaScript or web page creation get started turning information into visualization.Data is the new medium of choice for telling a story or presenting compelling information on the Internet and d3.js is an extraordinary framework for presentation of data on a web page.Is this book for you?It's not written for experts. It's put together as a guide to get you started if you're unsure what d3.js can do. It reads more like a story as it leads the reader through the basics of line graphs and on to discover animation, tooltips, tables, interfacing with MySQL databases via PHP, sankey diagrams, force diagrams, maps and more...Why was D3 Tips and Tricks written?Because in the process of learning things, it's a great way to remember them if you write them down :-).As a result, learning how to do cool stuff with D3 meant that I accumulated a sizeable number ways to help me out when the going got tricky. Then I realised that these could be useful for others who were trying out d3.js and who were at a similar knowledge level.So here we are! A collection of tips and tricks for d3.js written by a noob for people who might consider that they're in the same situation :-).What's in the book?I've captured the appropriate code (in cool looking coloured text) and added in heaps of illustrations of what's going on so that you will get more traction at the start of your learning process than I did.The awesome that is Open Source.Please consider this an opportunity for you to contribute back to the Open Source community that makes products like d3.js possible. If you find something that can be improved about the book or think there's something that can be added, just let me know!The book has a lot of information in it. Currently (at time writing) it counts up to about 490 pages, so it's not a short read but I've tried to pitch it in sections so that if you find something interesting, you can read parts in isolation. There's a sizeable amount of content on the d3noob.org blog site from the book and hopefully between the two, people will find a way that will help them improve.So I hope you get something out of the book, please excuse the sometimes light-hearted conversational manner in which I approach the topic and enjoy D3!Kudos for D3 Tips and Tricks from d3noob.org;"Thanks, super helpful!" - Davo"Thanks for the help (reading through your book now, and it's awesome!)" - Jared"Thank you for doing this. I've been looking for something like this for a while." - Marla"You have just inspired me to give Sankey a fresh new face in Dex" - Patrick"Thank you - exactly what I was looking for explained clearly and succinctly" - Anon"Much appreciated.

The focus is on the "Journal of Social History" and the academic debate since its inception--how scholars have responded to the challenges and problems facing the discipline at different times. Connections are drawn between these developments found in JSH and the authors' own ideas and experiences of academic work, with the aim of assessing the state of the discipline in the early years of the 21st century. As a result of the very success of social history, it is argued that social historians have felt no reason to take scholarly risks for the last ten or fifteen years--there is simply no incentive for them to do so. Hence, the image becomes ossified and scholars are tempted to start treating social history as nothing more than a series of "sites of memory", as monuments that can neither be moved nor challenged, like a statue that is polished up solely so as to be able to gleam back resplendently into the eyes of those that behold it. The article severely critiques the conventional theoretical framework of social-historical research--the institutionalization of history--and an attempt is made to redefine the aims and parameters of history in order for it to achieve its full potential.},

  abstract = {In recent years, one of the two fully preserved ancient Greek tragic plays of disputed authorship, Rhesus, traditionally attributed to Euripides, has been the object of a quite lively scholarly interest. The rather extreme number, for the standards of classical philology, of four published commentaries in 10 years, by Athanasios D. Stefanis, [Euripides’]: Rhesus, Athens: Academy of Athens, 2004, Arne Feickert, Euripidis: Rhesus, Frankfurt: Lang, 2005, Vayos Liapis, A Commentary on the Rhesus Attributed to Euripides, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012, and Almut Fries, Pseudo-Euripides: Rhesus, Berlin: De Gruyter, 2014 (two of them in English), and one forthcoming by Marco Fantuzzi (also in English), tangibly prove the great vogue this drama enjoys nowadays. Its doubtful nature, as far as the fusion of tragic and comic elements is concerned (see further Burnett, Directions in Euripidean Criticism: A Collection of Essays, Durham: Duke University Press, pp. 13–51, 177–88, 1985), and, most of all, its controversial authorship and date still render it a riddle—even though its non-Euripidean origin is widely accepted. Our research is an attempt to unveil the authorial status of this play, employing traditional and non-traditional authorship attribution techniques. In fact, as it will become clear in the course of this work, the latter kind of methodology allows us to approach the author of Rhesus in a way that was not even thought possible until the present day.},

She provides a portrait of Iranian society over an exceptionally broad spectrum - the dynasty and its servitors, city elites and provincial rulers, and the religious classes, both ulama and Sufi. The work addresses two issues central to pre-modern Middle Eastern history: how a government without the monopoly of force controlled a heterogeneous society, and how a society with diffuse power structures remained stable over long periods. Written for an audience of students as well as scholars, this book provides the first broad analysis of political dynamics in late medieval Iran and challenges much received wisdom about civil and military power, the relationship of government to society, and the interaction of religious figures with the ruling class."--Jacket.},

This chapter first describes the formation of the Mongol empire, and then about the Mongols' western conquests. The Mongols replaced the familiar caliphate with a new imperial ideal and administrative methods conceived and tested in Mongolia and China. The Mongol empire was in the process of formation at the time of Chinggis Khan's death August 1227. Until 1259, the Mongol territories of the Middle East were part of an empire ruled from Mongolia. At this period, Transoxania was the only province directly under Mongol control and it fared better than other Islamic lands. Although the Mongol conquest put many Muslims under the rule of infidels, Mongol rule eventually resulted in a massive expansion of the dar al-islam. Muslims became predominant in western Anatolia and much of the western Eurasian steppe, while large Muslim minorities formed in parts of China.},

This paper explores the facts of Temür's career and the uses made of his image following his death, showing how his actions together with the stories circulated during his lifetime served to create a charisma that survives into our time. Tamerlane belonged to two worlds, the Islamic and the Turco-Mongolian, but was not eligible to hold the highest office in either one. To compensate for his low formal position, he deliberately created a persona which bordered on the supernatural. The dynasty he founded reworked earlier traditions to create the figure of a dynastic founder within both the Islamic and the Turkic traditions. Subsequent dynasties in the Middle East and Central and South Asia used Tamerlane to bolster their legitimacy, while European writers and historians found fascination in the contradictions of his personality and the monumentality of his ambitions. Many of the myths recounted later have their origins in stories apparently deliberately circulated by Tamerlane and his entourage. There is a striking continuity in the portrayal of Tamerlane and the use to which he has been put, from medieval Iran and India through the European Renaissance and Enlightenment to Russian, Soviet, and finally Uzbek formulations of history.},

There nonetheless remains a methodological aspect that has never (to our knowledge) been analyzed in relation to the judges-and-efficiency thesis. We thus show that both promoters and critics of the judges-and-efficiency thesis similarly use a definition of optimization in which history, constraints and path-dependency are viewed as obstacles that must be removed to reach the most efficient outcome. This is misleading. Efficiency cannot be defined in absolute terms, as a “global ideal” that would mean being free from any constraint, including historically deposited ones. That judges are obliged to refer to the past does not mean that they are unable to make the most efficient decision because constraints are part of the optimization process; or optimization is necessarily path-dependent. Thus, the output of legal systems cannot be efficient or inefficient per se. This is what we argue in this paper.},

This paper modifies this picture by examining the evidence for conflict and competition between pre-modern maritime polities in the western end of the Indian Ocean. In the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries maritime polities on the islands of Kish in the Persian Gulf and Dahlak in the Red Sea antagonized Aden's supremacy as the region's most frequented entrepot. In the subsequent three centuries, the Ayyubids and Rasulids of Yemen also strove to control maritime routes and networks. /// L'historiographie en vigueur de l'Océan Indien à l'époque précédant la venue des Ottomans et des Européens au XVIème siècle, décrit une aire commerciale généralement paisible parcourue aisément par des négociants cosmopolites par-delà les obstacles géographiques, ethniques, religieux et linguistiques. Cette contribution modifie cette image par un examen des témoignages des Vème/XIème et VIème/XIIe siècles qui attestent les conflits et rivalités des cités portuaires de Kish en la Golfe de Perse, de Dahlak en la Mer Rouge contestant la suprématie d'Aden, l'entrepôt le plus fréquenté.

It charts the launch and significance of ethnographic enquiry into this former oasis city within the context of Eurasianism, and illuminates the notion of soil in Russian thought, together with the central role it played in the study of the interrelationship between environmental factors and socio-cultural changes. The evidence will be used to present ethnographic accounts as a way of transferring knowledge between Asia and Europe, and argue in favour of a flexible approach negotiating between nature and culture, and as a process of hybridization, whereby cultures come together and, by learning from each other, create a pathway towards Eurasian integration and global intellectual interaction.},

Al-Ṭabarī considère que la politique fiscale de l'État, tout comme la religion en tant que norme juridique, sont liées au contrat social conclu entre le sommet de l'État et les propriétaires terriens. Aux yeux d'al-Tabarī, le système fiscal de la misāḥa et l'«État de droit» apparaissent comme des conditions essentielles à la survie du pouvoir impérial.

It argues that despite a post-colonial official historiography that ends abruptly with independence in 1962 and takes the colonial period and the War of Independence as the total meaning of history, Algerians are making judgments about the past and the present based on more recent periods and are thereby questioning the salience of official narratives of the past.},

The reinstitution of Chinggisid political control in Central Asia had little impact on society as a whole, except for the marked distinction between the khanly family and its military supporters, the Uzbek amirs. The Abu'l-Khayrid Shibanids, the Tuqay-Timurids, and the military and intellectual supporters of both Chinggisid lines are noteworthy for their continuation of the Timurid model of artistic and scholarly patronage.

It uses a broad range of examples to show how corpus data has led to methodological and theoretical innovation in linguistics in general. Clear and detailed explanations lay out the key issues of method and theory in contemporary corpus linguistics. A structured and coherent narrative links the historical development of the field to current topics in 'mainstream' linguistics. Practical activities and questions for discussion at the end of each chapter encourage students to test their understanding of what they have read and an extensive glossary provides easy access to definitions of technical terms used in the text"--},

For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the “tidyverse.” We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.

Drawing on a new dataset of policy reports, we show how economic ideas influenced climate policy advice by major international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank, from 1990 to 2017. In the 1990s, the neoclassical notion of weak complementarity between environmental protection and growth dominated debates on sustainable development. In the mid-2000s, economic thought on the environment diversified, as the idea of strong complementarity between environmental protection and growth emerged in the green growth discourse. Adaptations of Schumpeterian and Keynesian economics identified investment in energy innovation and infrastructure as drivers of growth. We thus identify a major transformation from a neoclassical paradigm to a diversified policy discourse, suggesting that climate policy has entered a postparadigmatic period. The diversification of ideas broadened policy advice from market-based policy to green industrial policy, including deployment subsidies and regulation.},

The first great moment of Marīnid intervention in the Peninsula corresponds to the rule of the sultan Abū Yūsuf, who mounted as many as five different expeditions between 673/1275 and 684/1285.

Moreover, the Tabaqat of Ibn Sad shows that he considered the Hanafi school Baghdadi, not Kufan. Kitab al-Marifa wa-al-tarikh of Fasawi shows that the Kufan background to Hanafi jurisprudence, together more generally with the identification of Kufa with ray and Medina with hadith, emerged only later in the ninth century.},

Muslim long-distance traders extended their control across the Sahara to trade and to secure the resources to trade. Egypt's commerce flourished owing to its agricultural and industrial production, especially of flax, a major crop for export and for the local industry. The seventh/thirteenth century saw a number of changes in long-distance commerce across the western half of the Islamic world, restoring earlier connections and asserting new modes of control. By this time the Islamic lands along the southern Mediterranean shore were tightly locked into the European-controlled Mediterranean economy.},

In this original and conceptually rich book, historian Alan Mikhail puts the history of human-animal relations at the center of the transformations of the Ottoman Empire from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. He uses the history of the empire's most important province, Egypt, to explain how human interactions with livestock, dogs, and charismatic megafauna changed more in a few centuries than they had for millennia. The human world became one in which animals' social and economic functions were diminished. Without animals, humans had to remake the societies they had built around the intimate and cooperative interactions between species. The political and even evolutionary consequences of this separation of people and animals were wrenching and often violent. In tracing these interspecies histories, this book offers a bold program for Ottoman historians--highlighting a new capacious periodization of the empire's history, integrating environmental history and other methodologies, and opening up archives in close to a dozen countries. The wide-ranging and creative analyses on offer also push far beyond Ottoman history to engage issues in animal studies, economic history, early modern history, and environmental history. Carefully crafted and compellingly argued, The Animal in Ottoman Egypt tells the story of the high price humans and animals paid as they entered the modern world"--},

Its environmental perspective shows how a shared reliance on natural resource management bound together extremely rural regions of the Ottoman Empire like Fayyum with centers of power in Istanbul and Cairo. It seeks to make two historiographical interventions. First, its focus on irrigation reveals how the centerperiphery model of early modern empires fails to capture the complexity of relationships that rural regions of the Ottoman Empire maintained with other provinces and towns both in the empire and beyond. Water in Fayyum grew food that forged connections of commodity movement with areas of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Second, through an examination of such intraimperial and transregional ties, this article argues that Egyptian peasants held much of the power in these relationships.},

This chapter first summarises the earliest evidence for a distinctive Muslim identity in the archaeological record. The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem marks a watershed in Islamic material culture, as among other things, it also provides evidence of a new sense of artistic ambition among the Muslim elite. Next, the chapter assesses changes in the countryside with particular emphasis on the elite country residences (qusur) of Greater Syria and the evolution of complex irrigation systems in different parts of the Islamic world. Then, it discusses the changes in the urban environment from the Late Antique period to the creation of new cities in Syria and Iraq during the early Abbasid caliphate. Finally, the chapter addresses changes in international trade from the Late Antique period to around 390/1000.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to explain why people become confused by questions about the relation between menal and physical events. When a question leads to confused, inconsistent answers, this may be (1) because the question is ultimately meaningless or at least unanswerable, but it may also be (2) because an adequate answer requires a powerful analytical apparatus. My view is that many important questions about relation between mind and brain are of this latter kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on he problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. In this paper we suggest a theory of why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. The paper does not go very far toward finding technical solutions to the questions, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},

This image is often paired with that of writing traces which are illegible and indistinguishable from camp remains or animal droppings, an unspeaking writing which is visually and semantically indistinguishable from its material support. Treating writing as a “cultural technique,” this article investigates writing in material culture in Arabia from the sixth to the eighth century CE to show that practices such as writing on shoes reflect a deliberate prioritization of the materiality of writing over its semantic content. Taking a media history approach allows us to see a preference for leather, recycled materials, and domestic artifacts as writing supports. This helps us understand why writing in these practices is not purely linguistic, abstract text but is associated with its visual effects, materials, and the physical activity of creating it rather than with reading it.},

  abstract = {The Chinese empire experienced a large expansion to the arid regions in the west during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). The Hexi Corridor, the Yanqi Basin, the southeastern part of the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin became part of the empire. The expansion of the Han Dynasty was accompanied by the significant intensification of irrigation farming along rivers draining the Qilian, Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses and dating of lake sediments and shorelines revealed that four large lakes in the region experienced falling levels, or were almost or completely desiccating. The level of Zhuyeze Lake was falling rapidly ca. 2100 years before present (a BP), and the accumulation of lake sediments was replaced by an alluvial fan setting in large parts of the basin. Lake Eastern Juyan desiccated ca. 1700 a BP. Lake Bosten experienced low levels and increasing salinities at ca. 2200 a BP. Lake sediments in the Lop Nur region were mostly replaced by aeolian sands during a period of near-desiccation at 1800 a BP. In contrast, records from fifteen lakes farther in the west, north or south of the Han Dynasty realm indicate relatively wet climate conditions ca. 2000 years ago. Thus, dramatic landscape changes including the near and complete desiccation of large lakes in the arid western part of today’s China probably resulted from the withdrawal of water from tributaries during the Han Dynasty. These changes likely represent the earliest man-made environmental disasters comparable to the recent Aral-Sea crisis.},

Of especial significance is his description~of a people whom he calls the Rūsiyyah.

In a high-profile investigation comparing note-taking writing on paper versus typing on a laptop keyboard, Mueller and Oppenheimer (Psychological Science, 25, 1159–1168, 2014) concluded that taking notes by longhand is superior. We conducted a direct replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and extended their work by including groups who took notes using eWriters and who did not take notes. Some trends suggested longhand superiority; however, performance did not consistently differ between any groups (experiments 1 and 2), including a group who did not take notes (experiment 2). Group differences were further decreased after students studied their notes (experiment 2). A meta-analysis (combining direct replications) of test performance revealed small (nonsignificant) effects favoring longhand. Based on the present outcomes and other available evidence, concluding which method is superior for improving the functions of note-taking seems premature.},

The Umayyads changed the physiognomy of Cordoba by erecting new buildings and fostering its extraordinary expansion. Archaeology is also a good indicator of the unrelenting Islamisation of the Iberian Peninsula. The most serious rebellions against the rule of the Aghlabids in Ifriqiya were led by members of the Arab army. It is no coincidence that both Ifriqiya and al-Andalus witnessed the proclamation of two rival caliphates in the early fourth/tenth century.},

These are bound to be, to a greater or lesser extent, arbitrary, but that does not imply that they are necessarily meaningless. It is possible to tell the story of early Islam, the mission of the Prophet Muḥammad, the first Arab Muslim expansion and the Umayyad and ʿAbbāsid caliphates as a single, integrated narrative. There is an essential unity to the historical evolution of the Muslim community, in its first four centuries, which lends itself to such an integrated treatment. From the eleventh century, and increasingly thereafter, this is no longer the case. The political unity represented by the early caliphates is no more. Though caliphs remained important for a time as local rulers, whether in Baghdad, Cairo or al-Andalus, and even more as instruments of legitimisation for Islamic regimes far and wide, real power passed to a multiplicity of sultans, amīrs, maliks and so on. There is nothing very surprising about this. At the point at which this volume commences, the Islamic world stretched uninterruptedly from Spain to Central Asia and northern India. Over the next few centuries it was to spread much further, deeper into India and to western China, and by oceanic routes to East Africa, coastal South Asia, South-East Asia and southern China.},

However sophisticated their weapons and other technology, until at least the 1880s European colonial armies were forced to rely exclusively on baggage animals if they wanted to move around: railways arrived very late in the history of European expansion. In Central Asia this meant rounding up, loading, managing and feeding tens of thousands of camels, which could only be furnished by the pastoral groups who inhabited the region, who in some cases were also the objects of conquest. Camel transport placed certain structural constraints on European conquest in Central Asia: firstly it meant that the forces involved were almost always very small; secondly it prevented the launching of spontaneous or unauthorised campaigns by “men on the spot,” as every advance had to be preceded by the rounding up of the necessary baggage animals, and the creation of a budget to pay for then. Finally, the constraints imposed by camel transport ensured that British and Russian armies would never meet in Central Asia, and that a Russian invasion of India was a chimera.},

However, their archives have been slow to grow. This article is directed toward historians who are contemplating such projects. Repository development is very valuable. On the other hand, studies show that repository projects that rely upon voluntary contribution from numerous researchers seldom reach critical mass. Our surveys and our study of the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis Data Hoover Project confirm this assessment. We conclude that historical data repositories remain poorly aligned with present day scholarly practices and are unlikely to realize their promise until the social life of data becomes a part of the profession.

We have very little information about the teaching system and curriculum in Najaf before the nineteenth century. In this essay, I will try to present the basic elements of a Najaf ḥawza education as they exist in contemporary Iraq and compare it with a Najaf curriculum of 1913. Quite remarkably, the curriculum, teaching methods and patronage networks have been remarkably stable over the last century. Politics and reform movements have, however, had their effects on the curriculum too, as I shall explain in the course of this essay.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on students’ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

  abstract = {This research contributes to the area of corpus annotation and text mining by developing novel domain specific language resources. Most practical text mining applications restrict their domain. This research restricts the domain to the Qur'anic Text. In this thesis, a number of pre-processing steps were undertaken and annotation information were added to the Qur'an. The raw Arabic Qur'an was pre-processed into morphological units using the Qur'anic Arabic Corpus (QAC). Qur'anic terms were indexed and converted into a vector space model using techniques in Information Retrieval (IR). In parallel, nearly 24,000 Qur'anic personal pronouns were annotated with information on their referents. These referents are consolidated and organized into a total of over 1,000 ontological concepts. Moreover, a dataset of nearly 8,000 pairs of related Qur'anic verses are compiled from books of scholarly commentary on the Qur'an. This vector space model, the pronoun tagging, the verse relatedness dataset, and the part-of-speech tags available in QAC all together served for a number of Qur'anic text mining applications which were rendered online for public use. Among these applications: lemma concordance, collocation, POS search of the Qur'an, verse similarity measures, concept clouds of a given verse, pronominal anaphora and Qur'anic chapter similarity. Furthermore, machine learning experiments were conducted on automatic detection of verse similarity/relatedness as well as categorization of Qur'anic chapters based on their chronology of revelation. Domain specific linguistic features were investigated to induct learning algorithms. Results show that deep linguistic and world knowledge is needed to reach the human upper bound in certain computational tasks such as detecting text relatedness, question answering and textual entailment. However, many useful queries can be addressed using text mining techniques and layers of annotations made available through this research. The works presented here can be extended to include other similar texts like Hadith (i.e., saying of Prophet Muhammad), or other scriptures like the Gospels.},

  abstract = {Shihab al-Din al-Nuwayri was a fourteenth-century Egyptian polymath and the author of one of the greatest encyclopedias of the medieval Islamic world—a thirty-one-volume work entitled The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition. A storehouse of knowledge, this enormous book brought together materials on nearly every conceivable subject, from cosmology, zoology, and botany to philosophy, poetry, ethics, statecraft, and history. Composed in Cairo during the golden age of Islamic encyclopedic activity, the Ultimate Ambition was one of hundreds of large-scale compendia, literary anthologies, dictionaries, and chronicles produced at this time—an effort that was instrumental in organizing the archive of medieval Islamic thought.In the first study of this landmark work in a European language, Elias Muhanna explores its structure and contents, sources and influences, and reception and impact in the Islamic world and Europe. He sheds new light on the rise of encyclopedic literature in the learned cities of the Mamluk Empire and situates this intellectual movement alongside other encyclopedic traditions in the ancient, medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenment periods. He also uncovers al-Nuwayri’s world: a scene of bustling colleges, imperial chanceries, crowded libraries, and religious politics.Based on award-winning scholarship, The World in a Book opens up new areas in the comparative study of encyclopedic production and the transmission of knowledge.},

While there is now abundant technological support for reading and interpreting literary text in new ways through text-processing algorithms, the other parts of the cycle—exploration and understanding—have been relatively neglected. We are motivated by the literature on sensemaking, an area of computer science devoted to supporting open-ended analysis on large collections of data. Our software system integrates tools for algorithmic processing of text with interaction techniques that support the interpretive, exploratory, and note-taking aspects of scholarship. At present, the system supports grammatical search and contextual similarity determination, visualization of patterns of word context, and examination and organization of the source material for comparison and hypothesis building. This article illustrates its capabilities by analyzing language-use differences between male and female characters in Shakespeare’s plays. We find that when love is a major plot point, the language Shakespeare uses to refer to women becomes more physical, and the language referring to men becomes more sentimental. Future work will incorporate additional sensemaking tools to aid comparison, exploration, grouping, and pattern recognition.},

These mass digitization projects were efforts to absorb the print book infrastructure into a new one centered in computer networks. Mass book digitization has now faded from view, and here I trace its setbacks through a curious figure—the “orphan”—that emerged from within these projects and acted ultimately as an agent of impasse. In legal policy debates, an “orphan” refers to a copyrighted work whose owner cannot be found, but its history, range of meanings, and deployments reveal it to be considerably more complex. Based on fieldwork conducted at a digital library engaged in mass digitization, this paper analyzes the “orphan” as a personifying metaphor that digital library activists embraced in order to challenge and/or disrupt the social relations that adhere in and around books. The figure of the orphan haunts the techno-cultural infrastructural project of mass digitization, and stands, I argue, as a disenchanted emblem for “the book” in suspension between a disfavored past and a fantasized future.},

In the field of Buddhist studies (and especially in the area of Indian Buddhism), scholars face various obstacles in their efforts to share materials—in both paper and digital media. In establishing the RBIB, we have considered it to be of paramount importance to preserve the continuity of the prior tradition of studies within the paper medium, while at the same time developing a methodology that takes best advantage of the digital medium. After identifying six basic conditions that will satisfy the demands of both approaches, we have implemented a Web collaboration system that fulfills these conditions. Our system also makes functional parts of the RBIB that enable the presentation of the relationships between arbitrary fragments of related texts in various canonical languages through a user-friendly interface, which in turn allows users to learn how to edit and browse relationship data. Our system has thus far been highly evaluated by testers, and it has been further facilitated by recent developments in Information Communications Technology. Humanities digitization has a deep mutual relationship with this new technology.},

However, when the intention is to move beyond exploratory studies and use the results of such analyses as quantitative evidences, historians need to take into account the reliability of these techniques. The main goal of this article is to investigate the performance of different text mining methods for a specific task: the automatic identification of interdisciplinary works from a corpus of PhD dissertation abstracts. Based on the output of our study, we provide the research community of a new data set for analyzing recent changes in interdisciplinary practices in a large sample of European universities.

Particular attention is given to issues of structure, agency and habitus, the cultural autonomy of the school, arbitrary and necessary school cultures, and the distinction between primary and secondary effects on educational differences. Some specific criticisms, for example Elster's charge of a double account of domination, are also addressed. Bourdieu's concentration on habitus as the most significant generator of practice is held to be a theory of socialisation and the paper examines the nature of the explanation of social practice provided by such theories. The argument concludes with a plea for critical tolerance with respect to Bourdieu's work but with a suggestion that his account of socially differentiated educational attainment in terms of habitus is finally inadequate.},

This opposition had already started during the Civil War between al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn and it continued during the latter's reign after winning the Civil War. In the end, al-Maʾmūn was able to quell the opposition by accepting al-Muʿtaṣim, at a later stage, as a member of his own inner circle. Nevertheless, ultimately al-Maʾmūn's reign ended in a victory for the anti-Maʾmūn wing of his family. With this change, the Maʾmūnite vision of a strong caliphal institution passed away and henceforth the ʿAbbasid caliphate commenced its slow decline — confirmed later by the lack of an efficient central authority and the ensuing chaos. Thus, the collapse of the ʿAbbasid dynasty-caliphate started much earlier — after the first three decades of the ninth century CE and not during the second half of that century, contrary to what most textbooks on Islamic history state.},

This test case explores the possible relationships between proposed routes for communication and identified coastal sites with parameters modeled in geographic information system that affect travel in cultural, marine, and terrestrial contexts. The methods presented have significance beyond the Late Bronze Age Aegean. The development of a methodology that incorporates marine, cultural, and terrestrial environments provides a mechanism by which specific hypotheses regarding complex communication routes may be addressed in regions of the world where there is an intensive interplay between terrestrial and marine geographies.},

The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks"--},

  abstract = {This article presents an approach to using cognitive models of narrative discourse comprehension to define an explicit computational model of a reader’s comprehension process during reading, predicting aspects of narrative focus and inferencing with precision. This computational model is employed in a narrative discourse generation system to select and sequence content from a partial plan representing story world facts, objects, and events, creating discourses that satisfy comprehension criteria. Cognitive theories of narrative discourse comprehension define explicit models of a reader’s mental state during reading. These cognitive models are created to test hypotheses and explain empirical results about reader comprehension, but do not often contain sufficient precision for implementation on a computer. Therefore, they have not previously been suitable for computational narrative generation. The results of three experiments are presented and discussed, exhibiting empirical support for the approach presented. This work makes a number of contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in narrative discourse generation: a formal model of narrative focus, a formal model of online inferencing in narrative, a method of selecting narrative discourse content to satisfy comprehension criteria, and both implementation and evaluation of these models.},

The book explores multiple pathways of cleric radicalization and shows that the interplay of academic, religious, and political institutions has influenced the rise of modern jihadism through a mechanism of blocked ambition. As long as clerics' academic ambitions remain attainable, they are unlikely to espouse violent jihad. Clerics who are forced out of academia are more likely to turn to jihad for two reasons: jihadist ideas are attractive to those who see the system as turning against them, and preaching a jihad ideology can help these outsider clerics attract supporters and funds. The book draws on evidence from various sources, including large-scale statistical analysis of texts and network data obtained from the Internet, case studies of clerics' lives, and ethnographic participant observations at sites in Cairo, Egypt.},

Their citation data was processed using dimensionality reduction and clustering. The resulting clusters were identified, and the results are graphically represented. They suggest that the division of analytic and Continental philosophy in the considered timespan is overstated; that analytical, in contrast to Continental philosophy does not form a coherent group in recent philosophy; and that metaphors about the disciplinary structure should focus on the coherence and interconnectedness of a multitude of smaller and larger subfields.},

The manuscript was purportedly rescued from a bonfire shortly after Lewis’s death by his literary executor Walter Hooper, but the quality of the text is hardly vintage Lewis. Using computer stylometric programs made available by Eder et al.’s (2016: Stylometry with R: A package for computational text analysis. R Journal, 8(1): 107–21) ‘stylo’ package and a word length analysis, samples of each chapter of The Dark Tower were compared with works known to be by Lewis, two books by Hooper and a hoax letter concerning the bonfire by Anthony Marchington. Initial experiments found that the first six chapters of The Dark Tower were stylometrically consistent with Lewis’s known works, but the incomplete Chapter 7 was not. This may have been due to an abrupt change in genre, from narrative to pseudoscientific style. Using principal components analysis, it was found that the first and subsequent components were able to separate genre and individual style, and thus a plot of the second against the third principal components enabled the effects of genre to be filtered out. This showed that Chapter 7 was also consistent with the other samples of C. S. Lewis’s writing.},

This urban civilisation reached its greatest prosperity during the golden age of the Silk Road (sixth to ninth century ce). Rapid political and economic changes, accelerated by climatic variations, were observed during last millennium in this region. The newly developed tree-ring-based reconstruction of precipitation for the past millennium revealed a series of dry and wet stages. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), two dry periods occurred (900–1000 and 1200–1250), interrupted by a phase of wetter conditions. Distinct dry periods occurred around 1510–1650, 1750–1850, and 1920–1970, respectively. The juniper tree-ring record of moisture changes revealed that major dry and pluvial episodes were consistent with those indicated by hydroclimatic proxy data from adjacent areas. These climate fluctuations have had long- and short term consequences for human history in the territory of former Sogdiana.},

To highlight al-ʿAbbādī’s role in~constructing the identity and authority structures of the school the paper~focuses on three areas: first, how al-ʿAbbādī lays out his vision of the school in~the entry of the eponym of the school by delineating the areas of law that~distinguish al-Shāfiʿī from other founders of schools of law; second, how al-ʿAbbādī deals with contradictory positions held among members of the school;~third, how he gives the school of law also a theological identity (Ashʿarism) by~discussing such topics as free will, the createdness of the Qurʾān, and the~definition of faith (īmān). The paper details the author’s range of editorial hints~and techniques of presentation that guide his audience to the ‘correct’ Shāfiʿī~doctrine. It presents reasons why al-ʿAbbādī takes recourse to these measures~and points to the effects of his presentation of school doctrines.},

These waqfs (charitable foundations) had large agricultural holdings, and their financial developments consequently reflect the local agricultural conditions in central Anatolia. This analysis of the waqf account books deals with the short-term financial difficulties resulting from harvest failures and increasing grain prices. The widespread Celâlî rebellions seem to have caused agricultural crisis and the financial decline of waqfs in the early seventeenth century.},

  abstract = {Arabic script remains one of the most widely employed writing systems in the world, for Arabic and non-Arabic languages alike. Focusing on naskh, the style most commonly used across the Middle East, Letters of Light traces the evolution of Arabic script from its earliest inscriptions to digital fonts, from calligraphy to print and beyond. J.R. Osborn narrates this storied past for historians of the Islamic and Arab worlds, for students of communication and technology, and for contemporary practitioners. The partnership of reed pen and paper during the tenth century inaugurated a golden age of Arabic writing; the shape and proportions of classical calligraphy known as al-khatt al-mansub were formalized, and variations emerged to suit different types of content. The rise of movable type quickly led to European experiments in printing Arabic texts. Ottoman Turkish printers, more sensitive than their European counterparts to the script's nuances, adopted movable type more cautiously. Debates about "reforming" Arabic script for print technology persisted into the twentieth century. Arabic script continues to evolve in the digital age. Programmers have adapted it to the international Unicode standard, greatly facilitating Arabic presence online and in word processing. Tech companies are investing resources to facilitate support of Arabic in their products. Professional designers are bringing about a renaissance in the Arabic script community as they reinterpret classical aesthetics and push new boundaries in digital form.--},

The task is to identify (‘match’) the object previously seen. When the same pair of objects is used repeatedly, one or the other serving as ‘sample’, monkeys have difficulty making the match after a few seconds. The task has thus been used as a test of ‘short-term memory’. The present experiments show, however, that if a different pair of images is used for each trial, pigtailed macaques can make reliable matches 24–96 h after presentation of the ‘sample’; longer intervals have not been tested. While the macaques were not as proficient as man in this regard, this may well be a matter of technique in asking them the question. In any event they possess a visual system capable of prolonged retention of detail without benefit of linguistic support or rehearsal.},

  abstract = {The most fundamental concept in the conceptualization of early Arabic grammatical theory (c. 175-320 A. H./A. D. 920-790) is that of the Basran and Kufan linguistic schools, constructs which go back at least to the 4th/10th century. Weil (1913) and more recently Carter (1973) have called into question the historical validity of the schools, and even studies sympathetic to a more literal historical interpretation of them (Baalbaki 1981) fail to find evidence for their early (2nd/8th century) existence. A question which remains unanswered, however, is what the historical reality of early Arabic grammatical thinking was, if it was not dominated by the two schools. Using as sources not only Sîbawayh and al-Farrȃʿ, but various minor linguists as well, it is argued that the earliest period was one of linguistic heterogeneity, where linguists were relatively free to mix ideas and terminology from different sources. This period gave way to one of greater homogeneity, culminating in al-Sarrâj's Al-ʾUṣȗl fî l-Naḥw, a work which effectively standardized Arabic grammar. The emergence of the linguistic schools in the late 3rd/9th and early 4th/10th centuries can be understood as a reflex of this standardization, allowing linguists to recognize the diversity of the earlier period by assigning ideas and terminology which did not become standard to a subordinate Kufan position.},

  abstract = {Expansion of agricultural practices from the Fertile Crescent to China during the mid and late Holocene are believed to have shaped the early network of Silk Road routes and possibly regulated the dynamics of trade and exchange in the urban oases along the Silk Road throughout its existence. While the impacts of climate change on the Silk Road are more or less documented for the medieval period, they remain poorly understood for early history of the Silk Road, especially in Central Asia. We analyze hydroclimatic proxies derived from fluvial stratigraphy, geochronology, and tree-ring records that acted on various time scales in the Lake Balkhash Basin to learn how changes in water supply could have influenced the early farmers in the Semirechye region of southern Kazakhstan. Our approach aims to identify short-term and long-term variability of regional runoff and to compare the hydrological data with cultural dynamics coupled with the archaeological settlement pattern and agricultural production. The reconstructed runoff variability underscore the contribution of winter precipitation driven by the interaction between the Arctic oscillation and the Siberian High-Pressure System, to Central Asian river discharge. We show that Saka people of the Iron Age employed extensive ravine agriculture on the alluvial fans of the Tian Shan piedmont, where floodwater farming peaked between 400 BC and 200 BC. The early Silk Road farmers on the alluvial fans favored periods of reduced flood flows, river stability and glacier retreat in the Tian Shan Mountains. Moreover, they were able to apply simple flow control structures to lead water across the fan surface. It is very unlikely that changes in water supply ever significantly constricted agricultural expansion in this region.},

  abstract = {In Timurid times Persian littérateurs devised a new kind of logogriph (muʿammā) that differed con­siderably from the muʿammā as was known in the Arabic tradition. The most salient feature of the new, Persianate muʿammā, which is normally a couplet, is that it has two levels of meaning: an obvious or surface meaning (‘the poetic meaning’), and an encoded ‘riddle meaning’, which gives the clues to the solution of the riddle. Since the 16th century the new, Persianate muʿammā became very popular with Ottoman Turkish and Arabic littérateurs as well. In fact, to judge by the available evidence, it appears that the new muʿammā gradually became the most popular kind of literary riddle in Arabic. The present paper presents Quṭbaddīn an-Nahrawālī’s (917-990/1511-1582) Treasure of Names, the most influential Arabic treatise on the new muʿammā, which is modelled on earlier Persian treatises. It discusses the growth of the new muʿammā in Arabic, describes the rules applying to it as presented in an-Nahrawālī’s treatise, analyses several Arabic muʿammayāt cited in that treatise and concludes by mentioning some additional Ottoman-era Arabic treatises on the riddle that testify to the great popularity of the new muʿammā in Arabic until the late 19th century.},

While the pursuit of memex from a technological perspective shows its benefits now, it is still questionable whether today's digital artifacts truly realize Bush's insights into the human thinking process of association. As a response to Vannevar Bush's memex, this thesis suggests mmx, a conceptual system that supports cognition and interaction using a non-intrusive augmented vision. Visualizing cognitive activities as the linkages between knowledge nodes, mmx enables tracking, linking, rearranging, and sharing of information sources according to how humans think, amplifying personal and collective knowledge. A video prototype of mmx was created with this text as a final outcome. The processes of multi-dimensional studies derived from Vannevar Bush's memex, a design research for understanding association, and the final execution to create the video prototype for mmx ultimately reflect the relationship of today's information technology and design, and their ideal development to support human intelligence.},

Since the 1990s, KCL’s Department of Digital Humanities has been involved in the development of structured prosopographical databases using a general ‘factoid-oriented’ model of structure that links people to the information about them via spots in primary sources that assert that information. Recent developments, particularly the World Wide Web, and its related technologies around the Semantic Web, have promoted the possibility to both interconnecting dispersed data, and allowing it to be queried semantically. To the purpose of making available our prosopographical databases on the Semantic Web, in this article we review the principles behind our established factoid-based model and reformulate it using a more interoperable approach, based on knowledge representation principles and formal ontologies. In particular, we are going to focus primarily on a high-level semantic analysis of the factoid notion, on its relation to other cultural heritage standards such as CIDOC-CRM, and on the modularity and extensibility of the proposed solutions.},

It argues that these families were the dominant influence in the province, controlling many sources of revenue (including overseas trade routes and agricultural taxes). The main body of the paper is a study of one representative of such a family, Muḥammad b. Wāṣil al-Ḥanẓalī al-Tamīmī. His pedigree can be traced for more than four centuries, from early Islamic times to the 11th century. Finally, the paper discusses earlier scholarship on this figure, showing serious misrepresentations.},

  abstract = {During the past few decades Western studies of the origin of Islam have made~considerable advances in assessing sources which have long been considered a~repository of exegetic, legal and historical material about the first centuries of~Islam. Growing scepticism towards the Islamic foundation narratives and the~traditional accounts of Islamic history undermined the notion that, unlike other~religions, Islam “was born in the full light of history” and “its roots are on the~surface” (A. Renan). The study of the first centuries of Islam has thus become~the focus of clashing methodologies, often yielding conflicting accounts on~how, when and where Islam emerged. While studying Muslim traditions~(ḥadīths), Western Islamicists expressed varying opinions about reliability of~lines of narrative transmission (isnāds), which, according to the traditional~Muslim view, control the authenticity of the information included in the~substantive part of the tradition (matn). One pole of the spectrum is represented~by scholars who reject the link between the isnād and the matn. For them, the~isnād is a fictitious authentication device that does not give any information~about the historical development of the narrative. These scholars prefer to~study the relationship between topically affiliated narratives, whence they~derive information about the chronological development of the concepts~conveyed by these narratives (literary analysis). The other part of the spectrum~varies in the degree of acceptance of the isnāds. Nevertheless, these scholars~generally agree that, provided certain methodological stipulations are met, a considerable part of the transmission line is authentic and correctly represents~the ways through which the traditions were transmitted. With certain~qualifications, the method of scholars who accept the isnād may be described~as isnād-cum-matn analysis. In this article, I study the famous ʿUbāda tradition~dealing with the punishment for adultery and fornication (zinā). First, I follow~the historical development of the tradition by means of literary analysis. Then I~apply to the same tradition the principles of isnād-cum-matn analysis.~Although different in their treatment of the ḥadīth material, the two approaches~are shown as capable of yielding results that are not mutually exclusive.},

Analysis of the roll reveals that it originated in Trebizond in the second half of the fourteenth century, and the roll is therefore considered within the cultural and political context of that small but active Greek kingdom. The article pays particular attention to the text and representation of a rare figure, Evgenios of Trebizond, who is included among a series of saints and prophets in order to enact that saint\&apos;s protection of the (evidently elite) patron of the roll. And through the series of texts and images about the letter and self-portrait of Christ, the Mandylion, the roll also stated the sacred destiny of Trebizond. The roll generated identity through its Greek Christian texts and images, and made clear the special role God had chosen for Trebizond.},

Thus, reading practice could induce a perceptual learning effect in early vision. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in literate and illiterate adults, we previously demonstrated an impact of reading acquisition on both high- and low-level occipitotemporal visual areas, but could not resolve the time course of these effects. To clarify whether literacy affects early vs. late stages of visual processing, we measured event-related potentials to various categories of visual stimuli in healthy adults with variable levels of literacy, including completely illiterate subjects, early-schooled literate subjects, and subjects who learned to read in adulthood (ex-illiterates). The stimuli included written letter strings forming pseudowords, on which literacy is expected to have a major impact, as well as faces, houses, tools, checkerboards, and false fonts. To evaluate the precision with which these stimuli were encoded, we studied repetition effects by presenting the stimuli in pairs composed of repeated, mirrored, or unrelated pictures from the same category. The results indicate that reading ability is correlated with a broad enhancement of early visual processing, including increased repetition suppression, suggesting better exemplar discrimination, and increased mirror discrimination, as early as ∼100–150 ms in the left occipitotemporal region. These effects were found with letter strings and false fonts, but also were partially generalized to other visual categories. Thus, learning to read affects the magnitude, precision, and invariance of early visual processing.},

(i) Combining information from the PASE.ac.uk prosopography and syntactically annotated corpora, I show that the choice of auxiliary with ofslægen ‘killed’ in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is related to how the killing occurred, with wearð ofslægen consistently signalling death in battle. This finding sheds new light on the deaths of people like king Osred (716) and the earls Burghelm and Muca (822). (ii) The syntactic choice between it happened that X Y-ed or X happened to Y in late Middle English texts appears to determine whether the scribe/author believes X to be in control of what happens, providing novel evidence on medieval views of accountability levels with regard to adultery, sinning, and casualties. Particular attention is paid to the language use of the scribe of the late medieval Alphabet of Tales and how it reveals his pragmatic attitude towards sex outside marriage.},

During a 5-year \textsc{ERC}-funded project, a team of researchers led by Peter E. Pormann has produced a 1.5m-word corpus of preliminary editions, and analysed it in multi-faceted ways. The team shared their digital editions with scholars from outside Manchester, and invited them to engage with the new material; these editions are now freely available to all under a Creative Commons license. In April 2015, they organised an international conference at which team members and other scholars discussed this rich commentary tradition from various vantage points. This special issue contains a selection of papers read at the conference. In this contribution, we introduce our project and its collaborators; list the texts in our corpus of preliminary editions and reflect on the scholarly analysis to which it has hitherto been subjected, ranging from Graeco-Arabic studies, textual criticism, medieval exegetical methods, medical theory and practice, and questions about the social history of medicine. We conclude with an outlook on the most pressing needs for future research, and close with acknowledgments for the manifold support that we have received.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the goals of the LdoD Digital Archive is to show Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet as a network of potential authorial intentions and a conjectural construction of its successive editors. Our digital representation of the dynamics of textual and bibliographical variation depends on both XML encoding of variation sites (deletions, additions, substitutions, etc.) and metatextual information concerning authorial and editorial witnesses (date, order, heteronym, etc.). While TEI-XML markup may be considered as a particular kind of critical apparatus on its own, it is through visualization tools and graphical interface that users will be able to engage critically with the dynamics of variation in authorial and editorial witnesses. Besides representation of textual and bibliographical variation in the work’s genetic and editorial history, the LdoD Digital Archive will enable readers to generate new virtual forms of the work, assuming the roles of editor and/or author. Our paper discusses the theoretical and technical aspects of the various strategies adopted for encoding, visualizing, and generating variation in the LdoD Digital Archive. These issues are discussed with the support of a prototype currently under development.},

  abstract = {From its formation in the early years of the thirteenth century, the Mongol Empire expanded rapidly along the steppe belt and trade routes comprising the Silk Road, forming partnerships with merchants and encouraging commerce, while also subjugating the resident nomadic and sedentary societies. In 1241–1242, the Mongols invaded and occupied Hungary for a year before mysteriously withdrawing eastward into the steppes. Many theories have been offered for this event and why Hungary’s border ended up marking the westernmost terminus of the Mongol Empire, including most recently Büntgen and Di Cosmo’s “environmental hypothesis” that short-term climatic fluctuation and environmental factors played a decisive role. This paper employs a comparative historical methodology to discuss three broad topics: the suitability of the Kingdom of Hungary for long-term occupation by the Mongols; the role that the climatic events of 1242 played in the famine that ravaged the kingdom after the withdrawal; and the role that environmental factors could have played in Mongol military setbacks and problems during the invasion. By doing so, this paper also aims to address additional points newly raised by Büntgen and Di Cosmo in a reply they made to an earlier article which questioned the enviromental hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The Byzantine Church adopted a Chalcedonian identity only slowly. At first the majority even of Chalcedonians played down the significance of the council, claiming that it did little more than repeat the teaching of the Nicene Creed. Down to 518 committed Chalcedonians, strongly upholding the teaching of the council, were vocal, but few. It is with Justin I (518–527) and his nephew Justinian I (527–565) that State and Church came to insist on the council. Justinian\&apos;s commitment to it has sometimes been doubted because of his repeated attempts to win back the non-Chalcedonians (Miaphysites) to the imperial Church by inviting them back without requiring subscription to the Chalcedonian Definition. He was motivated by a desire that even the Miaphysites would look to him as their patron, as required for the maintenance of the unity of the empire. But his theological writings make it clear that he was convinced of the truth of the teaching of Chalcedon. The age of Justinian thus saw the attainment of a truly Chalcedonian identity in the imperial Church. This was a matter of official doctrine. In the sphere of popular piety Chalcedon had less impact. The affirmation of Chalcedon shaped Byzantine communal identity less than the rejection of Chalcedon shaped that of Miaphysite Syria and Egypt.},

We also discuss evidence for the morphemic status of templates from aphasic errors, language games, and slips of the tongue. We conclude that the available external evidence is best accounted for within a morpheme-based theory of morphology that forms words by combining roots and templates.},

After waging successful campaigns in Shirvan and Baku, he finally headed for Tabriz, where he crowned himself king. The most significant policy change that he instituted once he crowned himself king was the proclamation of Shi'i Islam as the official state religion. Although Shah Ismail used many Persians who had been administrators during previous dynasties to run the bureaucracy of the new empire, in order to promote Shi'ism, he invited scholars and experts from Qum, a traditional Shi'i centre in Iran. Shah Tahmasp, Ismail's son, took steps to crush any sort of religious expression that considered him a messianic figure thereby transfiguring notions of Safavid kingly legitimacy.},

His Epistle is probably the most popular Sufi manual ever." "Written in 437/1045, it has served as a primary textbook for many generations of Sufi novices down to the present. Al-Qushayri has given us an illuminating insight into the everyday lives of Sufi devotees of the eighth to eleventh centuries C.E. and the moral and ethical dilemmas they were facing in trying to strike a delicate balance between their ascetic and mystical convictions and the exigencies of life in a society governed by rank, wealth, and military power." "In al-Qushayri's narrative, the Sufi 'friends of God' (awaliya') are depicted as the true, if uncrowned, 'kings' of this world, not those worldly rulers who appear to be lording it over the common herd of believers. Yet, even the most advanced Sufi masters should not take salvation for granted. Miracle-working, no matter how spectacular, cannot guarantee the Sufi a 'favorite outcome' in the afterlife, for it may be but a ruse on the part of God who wants to test the moral integrity of his servant. In the Epistle these and many other Sufi motifs are illustrated by the anecdotes and parables that show al-Qushayri's fellow Sufis in a wide variety of contexts: suffering from hunger and thirst in the desert, while performing pilgrimage to Mecca, participating in 'spiritual concerts', reciting the Qur'an, waging war against the 'infidel' enemy and their own desires, earning their livelihood, meditating in a retreat, praying, working miracles, interacting with the 'people of the market-place', their family members and peers, dreaming, and dying."--BOOK JACKET},

Especially in the field of digital paleography, quantitative features are much needed to differentiate glyphs. We describe an elaborate set of metrics that quantify qualitative information contained in characters and hence indirectly also quantify the scribal features. We broadly divide the metrics into several categories and describe each individual metric with its underlying qualitative significance. The metrics are largely derived from the related area of gesture design and recognition. We also propose several novel metrics. The described metrics are soundly grounded on the principles of handwriting production and handwriting analysis. These computed metrics could serve as descriptors for scripts and also be used for comparing and analyzing scripts. We illustrate some quantitative analysis based on the proposed metrics by applying it to the paleographic evolution of four major Indic scripts from Brahmi. We also outline future work.},

The possibility of being anonymous avoids censorship and enables freedom of expression. Nevertheless, this anonymity might lead to cybersecurity issues, such as opinion spam, sexual harassment, incitement to hatred or even terrorism propaganda. In such cases, there is a need to know more about the anonymous users and this could be useful in several domains beyond security and forensics such as marketing, for example. In this paper, we focus on a fine-grained analysis of language varieties while considering also the authors’ demographics. We present a Low-Dimensionality Statistical Embedding method to represent text documents. We compared the performance of this method with the best performing teams in the Author Profiling task at PAN 2017. We obtained an average accuracy of 92.08\% versus 91.84\% for the best performing team at PAN 2017. We also analyse the relationship of the language variety identification with the authors’ gender. Furthermore, we applied our proposed method to a more fine-grained annotated corpus of Arabic varieties covering 22 Arab countries and obtained an overall accuracy of 88.89\%. We have also investigated the effect of the authors’ age and gender on the identification of the different Arabic varieties, as well as the effect of the corpus size on the performance of our method.},

  abstract = {Does Silicon Valley deserve the credit it gets for digital creativity and social media? Joy Lisi Rankin questions this triumphalism by revisiting a pre-PC world where schools were not the last stop for mature consumer technologies but flourishing sites of innovative collaboration. A People's History of Computing in the United States reveals a forgotten time when students taught computers, rather than the other way around, and visionaries dreamed of networked access for all. The invention of the personal computer undoubtedly liberated users from corporate mainframes and brought computing into homes. But throughout the 1960s and 1970s a diverse group of teachers and students working together on academic computing systems conducted many of the activities we now recognize as personal and social computing. Their networks were centered in New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Illinois, but they connected far-flung users. Rankin draws on detailed records to explore how users exchanged messages, programmed music and poems, fostered communities, and developed computer games, including The Oregon Trail. No less than the male inventors, garage hobbyists, and eccentric billionaires of Palo Alto, these unsung pioneers helped shape our digital world. By imagining computing as an interactive commons, the early denizens of the digital realm seeded today's debate about whether the internet should be a public utility and laid the groundwork for national and international debates over net neutrality. Rankin offers a radical precedent for a more democratic digital culture, and new models for the next generation of activists, educators, coders, and makers.--},

  abstract = {The modern sense of “Greater Khorasan” today corresponds to a territory which not only comprises the region in the east of Iran but also, beyond Iranian frontiers, a part of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. In the past this entity was simply defined as Khorasan. In the Sassanidera Khorasan defined the “Eastern lands”. In the Islamic era this term was again taken up in the same sense it previously enjoyed. The Arab sources of the first centuries all mention the eastern regions under the same toponym, Khorasan. Khorasan was the gateway used by Alexander the Great to go into Bactria and India and, inversely, that through which the Seljuks and Mongols entered Iran. In a diachronic context Khorasan was a transit zone, a passage, a crossroads, which, above all in the medieval period, saw the creation of different commercial routes leading to the north, towards India, to the west and into China.  In this framework, archaeological researches will be the guiding principle which will help us to take stock of a material culture which, as its history, is very diversified. They also offer valuable elements on commercial links between the principal towns of Khorasan. This book will provide the opportunity to better know the most recent elements of the principal constitutive sites of this geographical and political entity.},

  abstract = {Nishapur in eastern Iran was an important Silk Road city, its position providing links to central Asia and China, Afghanistan and India, the Persian Gulf and the west. Despite previous excavations there are many unresolved questions surrounding the site; when was the city founded? Is Nishapur a Sasanian city? Was it founded by the Sasanian king Shapur I or II? The question of chronology of occupation and the ceramic sequence is also problematic particularly for late antiquity and the medieval period, as well as a complete topography of the site. The Irano-French archaeological mission at Nishapur (2004 to 2007) (CNRS-MAEE-Musée du Louvre) focused on the Qohandez, or citadel, the oldest part of Nishapur. Excavations were conducted in different areas of the mound, in order to address these questions. After an introduction to the site and the former American and Iranian excavations, this book presents the stratigraphy and the pottery of the site. The difficulties involved in establishing a precise history of the site, as well as the complexities of studying the pottery led to a program of analysis undertaken by the Research Centre of French Museums (C2RMF). Chemical and petrographic analysis, thermoluminescence (TL) dating and archaeomagnetism analysis as support to the TL results were done. A pottery database has been created regrouping the stratigraphical and laboratory analyses data, in order to manage and present an organized corpus of 1000 samples. The combination of the data from the stratigraphical and laboratory analyses gives an accurate and completely new chronology of the site. Moreover, the study also brought to light a new typological sequence of the ceramic, as well as new data about the pottery production at Nishapur.Table of Contents Introduction     I - Historical and Geographical Background   1.

The author considers the evidence for the use of inflammable materials, and then moves to the question of gunpowder. The widespread (not quite universal) consensus that the Chinese used gunpowder is discussed, and then attention moves to Hulegu's expedition to western Asia in the 1250s. It is pointed out that none of the major sources seems to imply the use of anything that might be construed as gunpowder technology during those campaigns. Lastly, the author considers, in some detail, sieges conducted by the Ilkhanid Mongols against Mamluk border strongholds during the succeeding decades, drawing attention to and explaining those sieges' increasing lack of success.},

To date, historians have explained this decision only in political or ideological terms, paying little attention to its implications for the judicial system. Here I argue that the purpose of the new quadruple structure of the judiciary was two-fold: to create a uniform but at the same time flexible legal system. The need for predictable and stable legal rules was addressed by limiting qāḍīs' discretion and promoting taqlīd, i.e., adherence to established school doctrine. The establishment of Chief Qāḍīs from the four schools of law, on the other hand, allowed for flexibility and prevented the legal system from becoming too rigid. The quadruple judiciary enabled litigants, regardless of personal school affiliation, to choose from the doctrines of the four schools.},

In the course of thirty-five chapters, this book guided the reader on a journey from the outermost cosmos and planets to Earth and its lands, islands, features, and inhabitants. This treatise, known as The Book of Curiosities, was unknown to modern scholars until a remarkable manuscript copy surfaced in 2000. Lost Maps of the Caliphs provides the first general overview of The Book of Curiosities and the unique insight it offers into medieval Islamic thought. Opening with an account of the remarkable discovery of the manuscript and its purchase by the Bodleian Library, the authors use The Book of Curiosities to re-evaluate the development of astrology, geography, and cartography in the first four centuries of Islam. Their account assesses the transmission of Late Antique geography to the Islamic world, unearths the logic behind abstract maritime diagrams, and considers the palaces and walls that dominate medieval Islamic plans of towns and ports. Early astronomical maps and drawings demonstrate the medieval understanding of the structure of the cosmos and illustrate the pervasive assumption that almost any visible celestial event had an effect upon life on Earth. Lost Maps of the Caliphs also reconsiders the history of global communication networks at the turn of the previous millennium. It shows the Fatimid Empire, and its capital Cairo, as a global maritime power, with tentacles spanning from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus Valley and the East African coast. As Lost Maps of the Caliphs makes clear, not only is The Book of Curiosities one of the greatest achievements of medieval mapmaking, it is also a remarkable contribution to the story of Islamic civilization that opens an unexpected window to the medieval Islamic view of the world.

  abstract = {Normally, software documentations are produced, informally. They are written in the unnatural and non-structural form of the language, such as user manuals, user requirements, design documentation, tutorials, support documentation, and so on. Recent studies show that 61\% of software projects are subject to failure or challenges due to an increase in the costs and production time. Various factors may lead to this issue, and one of the major contributing factors is the lack of links between the software's source code and its related documents. The significance of software development and the possibility of making prospective changes by the development team necessitate an understanding of the links between various sections of codes and documentations. Therefore, it is crucial to design a system to link the software codes to their corresponding textual documentation. This article proposes a model for recovering the latent, but traceable links between software source codes and existing documents based on word extraction and function name separation. The contributions in this article include: (1) a model based on word extraction from document and source codes; (2) the proposal of an algorithm for splitting compound words and words that are connected to one another and completing abbreviations used in the names of functions, variables, and output commands; and (3) a new algorithm that is proposed for retrieving traceable latent links between the source code and documents. Two data sets are used in this research and the achieved results will be reported in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure. The experimental results are promising and indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms its counterparts.},

  abstract = {"In Western popular imagination, the Caliphate often conjures up an array of negative images, while rallies organised in support of resurrecting the Caliphate are treated with a mixture of apprehension and disdain, as if they were the first steps towards usurping democracy. Yet these images and perceptions have little to do with reality. While some Muslims may be nostalgic for the Caliphate, only very few today seek to make that dream come true. Yet the Caliphate can be evoked as a powerful rallying call and a symbol that draws on an imagined past and longing for reproducing or emulating it as an ideal Islamic polity. The Caliphate today is a contested concept among many actors in the Muslim world, Europe and beyond, the reinvention and imagining of which may appear puzzling to most of us. Demystifying the Caliphate sheds light on both the historical debates following the demise of the last Ottoman Caliphate and controversies surrounding recent calls to resurrect it, transcending alarmist agendas to answer fundamental questions about why the memory of the Caliphate lingers on among diverse Muslims. From London to the Caucasus, to Jakarta, Istanbul, and Baghdad, the contributors explore the concept of the Caliphate and the re-imagining of the Muslim ummah as a diverse multi-ethnic community."--},

This paper will analyze the results in this area of research and align them with the Diffusion of Innovations Theory that includes the Rogers Diffusion of Innovations Curve, innovation categories, and the factors affecting the diffusion process of an innovation. This analysis will give libraries a better understanding of who is using academic e-books, why academic e-books are being used, and how to influence the behaviour of the academic libraries' patrons to increase their use of academic e-books. An analysis of these three areas will help libraries to develop effective marketing and education strategies aimed at increasing e-book usage.},

The rise of the Sunni-Zaas and Askiyās of Gao was accompanied by a complex shift of emphasis in Sudanic Islam.

The advance of Arab tribes to the south during the ninth/fifteenth century linked the Maghrib closer to the Sahel. In the east, Egyptian Shuwa Arabs penetrated the Chad region. From Tunisia, the Ottomans intervened in the Sahara trade. During the 'age of empires', Muslim existence south of the Sahara could be, very generally, depicted as one in quarantine. Muslims, hitherto, were newcomers: arriving as individuals or in family units, as traders, refugees, travellers or professionals, they settled in confined areas, which sometimes developed into urban quarters, and offered their religious services. The case of the Bambara demonstrates the particularly slow penetration of Islamic features into the vast rural triangle extending among the urban centres along the Niger, from Segu up to Timbuktu and the Senegal river.},

The majority of this research has centered at the small port-fortress of Qsar es-Seghir on the Strait of Gibraltar. In the 13th century the town was enclosed within a circular fortification wall with twenty-nine evenly spaced defensive towers and three double-bent-axis entry gates. By means of a systematic sampling program, we have located examples of the major social institutions: the congregational mosque, a public bath and the central market area. Evidence from portions of twenty houses we have excavated reveal a uniformity in certain design principles juxtaposed against a diversity of decorative and layout details. Quantitative analyses are being conducted to characterize the assemblage, refine the chronology, and elucidate the community structure. During the past few years the research focus of the project has been expanded to a regional level through test excavations at five other sites. The most important of these is the 9th to 11th century Idrisid regional capital of al-Basra. A systematic program of test excavations has brought to light the first exposure of Idrisid-period architecture and artifacts in Morocco. Noteworthy among our discoveries are two well-preserved ceramic kilns of the updraft variety. Investigations to characterize this community and to understand the changes it experienced are currently being pursued.},

Naṣr, commonly called Ibn al-Māristānīya, has long been known as a continuator of al-Khaṭīb al Baghdādī's "History" and as a biographer of the eminent Ḥanbalite vizier Yaḥyā b. Hubaira. Recently, his public activities during the reign of an-Nāṣir, as associate of and spokesman for the Ḥanbalite vizier and majordomo ʿUbaidallāh b. Yūnus, have drawn scholarly attention, and he has been described as a staunch and prominent advocate of traditionalist Sunnite orthodoxy in the last quarter of the sixth/twelfth century. While many of the facts concerning his life are, therefore, known, the man Ibn al-Māristānīya himself is not, although in my opinion the available textual evidence allows the reader to draw some conclusions as to the driving forces behind his actions. Information remains too scarce to write a full biography of him but Ibn al-Māristānīya does come to life as something more than a spokesman of certain religio-political tendencies. The subjective side of his career has had a particular appeal for me, and it may command the interest of other students of Islamic history as well, not because he stands out markedly from among his contemporaries, but rather because he shared his ambitions and achievements with other talented and aspiring men of his time. He may turn out to be representative of a type-although this would first have to be corroborated by other, similar studies. This paper is primarily concerned, not with the sequence of events in Ibn al-Māristānīya's biography, but with the way his character and motives may have contributed to the shaping of his life and how they were in their turn affected by changing circumstances; his role in the politics and letters of his time will consequently be reassessed.},

This problem also underlies Dipesh Chakrabarty’s widely discussed call for “provincializing Europe.” In this article, I discuss the relationship between universals and practices of periodization, i. e., certain ways of shaping time, in the works of the Moroccan historian and intellectual Abdallah Laroui (*1933). I present Laroui’s contribution to this debate by focusing on how his approach makes possible to historicize representations of time from a universalist, dialectical, and post-foundationalist perspective. I discuss how he develops a distinction between time and temporalities in relation to forms of historiography and how he distinguishes between the preservation of memory and tradition as a process of canonization on the one hand and analytic critique and profane politics on the other hand. I argue that by spelling out these temporal presuppositions, Laroui effectively opens up a post-foundationalist view of the social and concepts such as Islam and modernity. I conclude with a brief observation of how Laroui’s account of multiple temporalities challenges ahistorical representations of “the human.”},

Trends in biblical studies and general literary theory are considered as prompting this greater attentions to the aesthetics of texts.

  abstract = {The ancient and Late Antique history of Eurasia could be reasonably (if not generously) characterised as a series of experiments in assembling communities through two sometimes complementary, contradictory or overlapping processes. The first was unambiguously political: building states and empires through conquest and some combination of occupation, emigration, colonisation, administration and exploitation. The other was ambiguously ideological, intellectual, spiritual and cultural: creating religious and philosophical systems of thought and conduct through some combination of inspiration, revelation, reflection and systematic teaching. Some 1,500 years or so after the end of Late Antiquity some of the religious and philosophical systems have proven more durable than the necessarily fragile political ones, in large measure because they have ridden the back of those strong polities: from Hellenism through Christianity to Confucianism, the biggest success stories feature ruling elites that offered robust sanction and patronage. What would Near Eastern history be like had the Sasanian shah Wahrām I followed his predecessors in favouring, rather than imprisoning, Mani (d. 276)? The opposite scenario poses questions too. How would Chinese history appear had the Song failed to oversee the rise of Neo-Confucianism?},

The event is said to have taken place in year 763 of the Common Era, some thirteen years after the revolution that brought the ʿAbbāsids to power.It was reported on the authority of Muḥammad b. Ṣāliḥ b. al-Naṭṭāḥ, on the authority of Muḥammad b. Jābir and his father, who said: When Abū Jaʿfar decided to build the city of Baghdad, he saw a monk, to whom he called out. When he responded, he asked him, ‘Do you find in your books [a prediction] that a city will be built here?’ ‘Yes’, said the monk, ‘Miqlāṣ will build it.’ Abū Jaʿfar exclaimed, ‘I was called Miqlāṣ when I was young!’, to which the monk said, ‘Then you must be the one to build it!’He [the narrator] then continued: Likewise, when Abū Jaʿfar decided to build the city of al-Rāfiqa, which is in territory that once belonged to the Byzantines, the people of [the nearby city of] al-Raqqa objected and resolved to fight him, saying, ‘You will ruin our markets, take away our livelihoods and reduce our houses. Abū Jaqfar was determined to take them on, and wrote to a monk in the [nearby] monastery, asking: ‘Do you know anything about a city that will be built here?’ The monk replied, ‘I have heard that a man called Miqlās. will build it,’ so Abu Jaqfar said, ‘I am Miqlās.!’ So he built it on the model of Baghdad, except for the walls, the iron gates and the single ditch.},

The hijra thus marked a new beginning for Muhammad and his followers. Things are less clear in Arabia than people would wish them to be, but monotheism had certainly gained a solid foothold well before Muhammad. Abraha's ill-fated expedition to the Hijaz is known only to the Quran, but it conforms to the pattern of his Arabian expansion, which is partially documented in a number of inscriptions. Muhammad died in early June 632 after a short illness. Civil war was thus about succession to the office of caliphate, which all Muslims acknowledged should be the ruling institution of the nascent state. In the second fitna and the early Marwanid period, Kharijites challenges Umayyad authority and effective power.},

  abstract = {The late 1970s and early 1980s were a propitious yet challenging time for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, as its elites sought to define the movement's priorities in the face of new opportunities to spread their call (da‘wa). The debate over preaching, while one of strategic assessment, also involved a negotiation of intellectual hierarchy: Should laymen lead Egypt's oldest Islamist organization, or should scholars? In contrast to previous studies that focus on how laymen led the Brotherhood's return to grassroots preaching, this article reintegrates scholars into the story of da‘wa by focusing on the organization's most prominent ‘ālim, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, and his vision of institution-based preacher education and extra-institutional activism. Drawing on three books written by Qaradawi on this topic between the mid-1970s and early 1980s, this article casts lights not only on this Islamist scholar's claim to religious authority as he sought to mold the Brotherhood, but also on the ways in which projects of mass mobilization – whether grassroots preaching or the reform of state-sponsored educational curricula – have transformed scholarly claims to authority more broadly.},

  abstract = {The international perspectives on these issues are especially valuable in an increasingly connected, but still institutionally and administratively diverse world. The research addressed in several chapters in this volume includes issues around technical standards bodies like EpiDoc and the TEI, engaging with ways these standards are implemented, documented, taught, used in the process of transcribing and annotating texts, and used to generate publications and as the basis for advanced textual or corpus research. Other chapters focus on various aspects of philological research and content creation, including collaborative or community driven efforts, and the issues surrounding editorial oversight, curation, maintenance and sustainability of these resources. Research into the ancient languages and linguistics, in particular Greek, and the language teaching that is a staple of our discipline, are also discussed in several chapters, in particular for ways in which advanced research methods can lead into language technologies and vice versa and ways in which the skills around teaching can be used for public engagement, and vice versa. A common thread through much of the volume is the importance of open access publication or open source development and distribution of texts, materials, tools and standards, both because of the public good provided by such models (circulating materials often already paid for out of the public purse), and the ability to reach non-standard audiences, those who cannot access rich university libraries or afford expensive print volumes. Linked Open Data is another technology that results in wide and free distribution of structured information both within and outside academic circles, and several chapters present academic work that includes ontologies and RDF, either as a direct research output or as essential part of the communication and knowledge representation. Several chapters focus not on the literary and philological side of classics, but on the study of cultural heritage, archaeology, and the material supports on which original textual and artistic material are engraved or otherwise inscribed, addressing both the capture and analysis of artefacts in both 2D and 3D, the representation of data through archaeological standards, and the importance of sharing information and expertise between the several domains both within and without academia that study, record and conserve ancient objects. Almost without exception, the authors reflect on the issues of interdisciplinarity and collaboration, the relationship between their research practice and teaching and/or communication with a wider public, and the importance of the role of the academic researcher in contemporary society and in the context of cutting edge technologies. How research is communicated in a world of instant- access blogging and 140-character micromessaging, and how our expectations of the media affect not only how we publish but how we conduct our research, are questions about which all scholars need to be aware and self-critical.},

Tracing one of the most important eras and turning points of printing industry technological transitions, this 340-page book is for those wanting to understand the technology and impact of phototypesetting that linked the centuries-old practice of hot metal typesetting and letterpress printing with the computer age. Romano dedicated this book to the late Jonathan Seybold, a well-know pioneer in the development and advancement of phototypesetting.  After years of preparation, Roman spent 10 weeks at Cal Poly finalizing the manuscript and included 13 Cal Poly students as co-authors. All production took place in Cal Poly's laboratories by University Graphic System (UGS), the Cal Poly Graphic Communication Department's experiential student-run faculty-supervised printing, publishing, and imaging company. Romano calls this book, "...a time capsule for a time of technological upheaval in the printing industry. Romano notes, "the narrative ends in 1985 as desktop publishing and laser imagesetting were being introduced." \textasciitilde{} All proceeds from the sales of the book go to support graphic communication education at Cal Poly. Each book is personally hand-signed by Frank Romano.},

In light of these results, we perhaps may think of al-Dhahabī as one of the earliest quantitative historians. Although we do not have conclusive evidence about how exactly al-Dhahabī worked with his data, the paper argues that all necessary mathematical, visual and ‘mechanical’ techniques that would facilitate data analysis already existed, and that al-Dhahabī and other premodern Islamic historians could have used them.},

Yet a group emerged with its own distinctive literature and art, its own network, and historical consciousness. In an intricate process of adoption and rejection, the West Syrians selected elements from the cultures to which they were heirs, and from those with which they came into contact, thus defining a position of their own. In order to study this phenomenon, scholars from various disciplines, and affiliated to two different faculties, were brought together in a programme financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO.

His religious affiliation served him well in his career, as the Shâfiʿî elite of Jurjan, Nishapur, and probably other cities offered him their support. Nowhere was this support more crucial for him than in the celebrated literary contest in which he bested the famed poet and prose stylist Abû Bakr al-Khwârazmî, an ardent Shîʿite.

It traces the tradition from phonographic books made on wax cylinders to talking books made for blinded soldiers returning from the First World War and, much later, the commercial audiobooks heard today. Addressing the vexed relationship between orality and print, the author shows how talking books developed both as a way of reproducing printed books and as a way of overcoming their limitations. In a wide-ranging overview, he charts the talking book's evolution across numerous media (records, tapes, discs, digital files), its reception by a bemused public, and impassioned disputes over its legitimacy. Testimonials drawn from the archives of charities for war-blinded veterans and pioneering audio publishers including Caedmon, Books on Tape, and Audible vividly recreate how audiences over the past century have responded to literature read out loud. This book poses a series of conceptual questions too: What exactly is the relationship between spoken and printed texts? How does the experience of listening to books compare to that of reading them? What influence does a book's narrator have over its reception? What methods of close listening are appropriate to such narratives? What new formal possibilities are opened up by sound recording? Sound technology turns out to be every bit as important as screens to the book's ongoing transformation. In sum, this book breaks from convention by treating audiobooks as a distinctive art form that has profoundly influenced the way we read."--},

Marina Rustow tells the story of this extraordinary find, inviting us to reconsider the longstanding but mistaken consensus that before 1500 the dynasties of the Islamic Middle East produced few documents, and preserved even fewer.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Beginning with government documents before the Fatimids and paper’s westward spread across Asia, Rustow reveals a millennial tradition of state record keeping whose very continuities suggest the strength of Middle Eastern institutions, not their weakness. Tracing the complex routes by which Arabic documents made their way from Fatimid palace officials to Jewish scribes, the book provides a rare window onto a robust culture of documentation and archiving not only comparable to that of medieval Europe, but, in many cases, surpassing it. Above all, Rustow argues that the problem of archives in the medieval Middle East lies not with the region’s administrative culture, but with our failure to understand preindustrial documentary ecology.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Illustrated with stunning examples from the Cairo Geniza, this compelling book advances our understanding of documents as physical artifacts, showing how the records of the Fatimid caliphate, once recovered, deciphered, and studied, can help change our thinking about the medieval Islamicate world and about premodern polities more broadly.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This article provides an edition, translation, and discussion of a petition housed among the Genizah documents of the Bodleian Library directed to Sitt al-Mulk, half-sister of the caliph al-Ḥākim (386–411/996–1021) and head of the Fatimid state between his death and her own in 414/1023. Geoffrey Khan had previously identified two petitions to a Fatimid princess housed in Cambridge and New York; it is likely that they, too, were addressed to Sitt al-Mulk. Such documents elucidate Sitt al-Mulk's role in government after her brother's death and provide evidence for the chronicler al-Musabbiḥī's claim that she received and responded to petitions from subjects. The article offers possible explanations as to why petitions such as this one, which concerns an Ismaili mosque, should have found their way to the Jewish community of Fustat whose members reused and preserved them. It also suggests some broader conclusions about the dispersal, survival, or disappearance of pre-Ottoman Middle Eastern archives and documents.},

This discrepancy, I argue, confirms that the teacher was not a scholar who projected his own views back onto al-Shaybānī. The teacher was indeed al-Shaybānī himself. Stylistic analysis indicates that the book did not grow organically. It also shows that the Muwaṭṭa' of al-Shaybānī shared its origin with the Āthār; thus, the former, too, is authentic. The essay concludes with a comment on the authenticity of the materials attributed by al-Shaybānī to certain earlier authorities.},

The percentages of these morphemes in a text constitute its stylistic profile. The thus-defined stylistic profile is shown to vary in a smooth fashion over “time”, i.e. over the proposed chronological sequence of phases. Third, a similar thing holds for a profile based on the frequencies of 114 other common morphemes. Fourth, similar results are obtained for a list of 3693 relatively uncommon morphemes.

It is therefore desirable to delve into methodology more deeply than has been customary. The methodological question is this: By what criteria should one assess a proposed emendation? The answer will necessarily depend on one’s model of textual error. This is because any attempt to go from the given text to the original one will use a model of how and why the text could have changed in the first place.3 Some previous writings on this topic tend to conceive of error according to a “unitary model” that focuses on one specific kind, namely, what may be called an “error of the hand,” a type of scribal mistake that can generate a difficult text, that is, a text that is obscure, seemingly incorrect linguistically, or anomalous. I call for a variegated model that takes into account a wider range of possible errors, and in the course of evaluating some specific emendations, I discuss types of mistake that have not been yet considered. I show how the failure to take into account the different kinds of textual error can cast doubt on a proposed emendation that is otherwise supported by the unitary model.},

This article is focused on the causes of such regressions, which are variously attributed to climatic change, diversion of river courses and anthropogenic water withdrawal. The first factor has been researched by several geo-specialists and its potential impact has been preliminarily evaluated. The second factor has been considered only in the case of the Amu Darya river. The third factor—water withdrawal for irrigation purposes—has been hypothesized, though never deserved specific analysis. The article provides a quantitative evaluation of the total hectares covered by the medieval urban systems of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins, and of the coefficient of water use per hectare of walled towns during the X-XII centuries AD. Estimates of annual volumes of anthropogenic water withdrawal allow the investigation of the complex interaction of the three factors above in determining the hydrological conditions of the Aral Sea. On the basis of the calculation of possible scenarios of water mass balance, the occurrence of transmission losses by medieval diversions of the Syr Darya course has been suspected as the main cause of lake regressions, which is supported by geological considerations, archaeological data and historical accounts.},

Unlike traditional 3D modeling software, in which the user directly manipulates polygons to simulate form, procedural modeling entails the use of computer programming languages to write a semantic description of a building that then generates a polygonal model. Procedural modeling has the potential to address a number of issues related to 3D archaeological reconstructions which are of concern to digital humanists. Of particular interest for archaeologists and architectural historians is the ability to test hypothetical reconstructions of ancient architecture in a fully realized urban context. The procedural rules link each iteration of a model to its source material, allowing the degree of certainty present in each model to be accurately defined through the documentation of each step in the process of interpreting a given data set. Procedural modeling enhances the scholarly value of architectural reconstructions by providing a platform for the comparison and refutation of 3D visualizations, and advances the methodology of 3D modeling toward becoming an essential part of the digital humanist’s toolkit.},

  abstract = {This article explores trade guilds in early modern Madrid in light of the revisionist stream of research that has enriched our understanding of these institutions in the European context. It focuses on the relationship between governmental regulations, the evolution of guilds, and the changes in the industrial structure of the city, relying on information gathered from guild ordinances, tax rolls, and most importantly, over ten thousand master licenses and three thousand indenture contracts for fifty-three craft guilds. The analysis of this data set shows that the reproduction of Madrid’s guilds did not only depend on father-to-son transmission but rather on the admission of nonkin and immigrant workers. Contrary to previously held ideas about corporate rigidity and closed guilds, this study reveals a diverse and flexible guild system in which norm and practice did not always go hand in hand. We contend that despite their limited autonomy, guilds were able to create their own artisan labor markets due to the political control inherent in a court city. The long-term approach to the evolution of both apprenticeships and masterships in Madrid—covering from the mid-seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth century—has allowed us to establish comparisons with other European cities.},

This ended with Russian colonization. Conflict resolution was left to the sharīʿa courts; mediation continued to be important but state appointees were no longer officially involved in bringing it about. The Russian colonial and Soviet administrations made the community responsible for seeking amicable settlements. Only afterwards did they realize how easy this made it for local groups to circumvent the state’s supervision.},

  abstract = {The main aim of this article is to present the results of different experiments focused on the problem of model fitting process in topic modeling and its accuracy when applied to long texts. At the same time, in fact, the digital era has made available both enormous quantities of textual data and technological advances that have facilitated the development of techniques to automate the data coding and analysis processes. In the ambit of topic modeling, different procedures were born in order to analyze larger and larger collections of texts, namely corpora, but this has posed, and continues to pose, a series of methodological questions that urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, through a series of different experiments, this article is based on the following consideration: taking into account Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model (Blei et al. in J Mach Learn Res 3:993–1022, 2003; Blei and Lafferty in: Srivastava, Sahami (eds) Text mining: classification, clustering, and applications, Chapman \& Hall/CRC Press, Cambridge, 2009; Griffiths and Steyvers in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (PNAS), 101(Supplement 1):5228–5235, 2004), the problem of fitting model is crucial because the LDA algorithm demands that the number of topics is specified a priori. Needles to say, the number of topics to detect in a corpus is a parameter which affect the analysis results. Since there is a lack of experiments applied to long texts, our article tries to shed new light on the complex relationship between texts’ length and the optimal number of topics. In the conclusions, we present a clear-cut power-law relation between the optimal number of topics and the analyzed sample size, and we formulate it in a form of a mathematical model.},

Using records of mulberry crop failures as examples, the authors ask how gazetteer editors collated Yuan disaster records—initially collected to help prevent disasters and authorize the legitimacy of dynastic rule—in gazetteers and, in so doing, made them into ‘local’ knowledge. Digital humanities methods allow for both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and the authors deploy them to demonstrate how, in structured texts like the Chinese local gazetteers, they could help combine close reading of specific sections and larger-scale analysis of regional patterns. In the first part, the authors show how disasters were recorded in a Yuan Zhenjiang gazetteer to facilitate taxation and disaster prevention locally—a strategy rarely traceable in subsequent gazetteers until the Qing. In the second part, the authors shifted their perspective to the historical accumulation of data and what that reveals about the reception of Yuan disasters: whereas local gazetteers from the north generate long chronologies of mulberry disasters from the Ming to the Qing, others depict the south as disaster-free.},

Most typically in the digital humanities, algorithms for intertextual analysis search for approximate lexical correspondence that can be described as paraphrase. In this article, we look at a complimentary approach that more closely captures the behavior of the reader when faced with meaningful connections between texts in the absence of words that have the same form or stem, which constrains the match to semantics. The technique we employ for identifying such semantic intertextuality is the popular natural language processing strategy of semantic analysis. Unlike the typical scenario for semantic analysis, where a corpus of long form documents is available, we examine the far more limited textual fragments that embody intertextuality. We are primarily concerned with texts from antiquity, where small phrases or passages often form the locus of comparison. In this vein, we look at a specific case study of established parallels between book 1 of Lucan’s Civil War and all of Vergil’s Aeneid. Applying semantic analysis over these texts, we are able to recover parallels that lexical matching cannot, as well as discover new and interesting thematic matches between the two works.},

  abstract = {In the beginning was the Qur'an, the first book of Islam and also the first book of Arabic literature. Occasioned by the need to understand and interpret the word of God, and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims made an inventory and study of their tradition. This involved the collection, transmission and instruction of the sacred text, of the words and deeds of Muhammad, and also of poetry, both from before and after the rise of Islam, or pre-Islamic events, indeed of all matters regarded as pertinent to the proper and scholarly study of the tradition.This activity, which began in the last third of the seventh century, relied predominantly on aural study with a master, that is, on oral communication between teacher and student, although writing was already an integral part of this process.  And it was the genesis of one of the richest literatures of late antiquity and the middle ages, as is clear from the widespread dissemination of scholarship through writing and the attendant proliferation of books. In the present work, Professor Schoeler explains how this change - from predominantly oral/aural to written - came about. In particular, he looks at the relationship between the aural and the written and explains how the tension between the oral and the written resulted in a creative coexistence.},

I argue that these origins influenced Middle Eastern book history insofar as it took the topic of printing as its main focus. However, an unevenness characterized this focus since European printing became commonplace from the early sixteenth century onwards, whereas printing in the Middle East took off during the nineteenth century. The 400 years that separated these phenomena marked the rise of modern Europe, which print was considered to have helped advance. These years were also interpreted as representing the decline of the Islamicate world until it modernized along a Western model, including its widespread adoption of print. Focusing largely on scholarship written in English, I summarize the effects that such thinking has had in shaping Middle Eastern book history, and then conclude with my sense of the state of current research.},

It then goes on to chart the life-cycle of the rumor that two Ottoman sultans banned print as it originated in early modern Europe, was adopted by nineteenth century Ottomans, and stabilized through twentieth century historians. The primary sources are texts of early modern European and Ottoman origin, and contemporary western and Middle Eastern origin.},

  abstract = {Meaningful mediums is a study of the political economy of writing in the first Ottoman city to develop a sustained urban print culture.  Cairo’s writing economy comprised the longstanding manuscript industry, the governmental printing industry from the 1820s, and the for-profit private press printing industry from the 1850s.  I investigate these industries’ functions, interactions, and reputations to explore why Cairene printing developed and how contemporaries ascribed meaning to textual production during this period of flux.   This study relies on the texts themselves to generate the history of their production.  I aggregate the names, dates, and other information contained within their openings, contents, and colophons to chart the work of their producers and vendors for the first time.  I then contextualize this information through contemporary iconographic and descriptive depictions of Cairene texts.  My sources are drawn from libraries and private collections in America, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France.  They include formal and ephemeral manuscripts and printings.    Against narratives that invoke printing as a catalyst for modernity, I argue that printing was simply a tool.  Its adoption increased because it was useful for different actors like the state, private entrepreneurs, and scholars who employed it to respond to specific political, economic, and intellectual needs.  My argument reverses the causality of modernization narratives, in that I establish that printing was the result of practical demands instead of the origin of new demands.  As a tool, printing was deployed by Cairenes flexibly.  Some used it to appropriate western norms, including the idea that printing is a civilizing force.  Others used it to enact manuscript tradition.  The history of this process is important to social practices, like the creation of new professions.  But it is also important to historical legacy.  Nationalism, Enlightenment, and civil society are assigned their origins and proof in Cairene printings from the 1870s and 1880s.  Yet this narrative of the Middle East’s generic print modernity draws from the expectation for printings to engender public discourse and galvanize society, instead of from the words that these texts actually contain or an understanding of who made and consumed them and why.  To counter the prevailing idea that printing is fixed and universal in its value and effects, Meaningful mediums examines printing as both a social and economic practice, and itself a space for ideas.  It therefore emphasizes the significance of human agency, local context, constraints, and continuity during a period of momentous technological, textual, and cultural change.   In conclusion, this study documents Cairenes’ incorporation of printing into their political economy of writing and revises the widely held notion that this process was an agent of social change, a marker of modernity and colonial restructuring, and a foreign disruptor of local textual tradition.},

  abstract = {This article examines the political economy of Cairo's emerging Arabic private printing industry during the third quarter of the 19th century. I use the constituent texts of the industry to demonstrate that it developed upon the speculative model of commissioning, whereby individuals paid printers to produce particular works of their choosing. Commissioning indicates that Egyptian private printing grew from local traditions for producing handwritten texts. Nevertheless, print commissioning differed from manuscript commissioning by requiring individuals to assume great financial risk. I explore the nature and implications of this divergence through a treatise published in 1871 by Musa Kastali, a particularly prolific printer who helped to professionalize Cairene printing. Musa's treatise details his legal battle with a famous Azhari commissioner, and is unique for describing a printer's business practices. It demonstrates the importance of situating printings within their socioeconomic contexts in addition to their intellectual ones, a task which cannot be done without an appreciation for the functioning of the printing industry at a local level.},

  abstract = {The Qur'anic reading tradition's approach to Arabic linguistic thought was largely prefigured by the desire to preserve physically the oral language of scripture, ensuring its textual integrity was never compromised. Qur'anic readers evolved rudimentary models of linguistic thought which were purposefully anchored to the service of scripture. These readers devised improvements in orthography; they devoted treatises to the articulation of scripture, defining the conventions therein; and they collated with precision the stock of readings enshrined within the Qur'anic canon. These functional linguistic procedures were designed to project meticulously the liturgical and spiritual value of scripture; moreover, they were governed by the pre-eminent ascendancy of precedents. This linguistic activity served as a catalyst for Arabic linguistic thought. Emerging from the ranks of these readers are figures who sought to relate the linguistic phenomena inherent in the corpus of Qur'anic readings to a theory of language; paradoxically, the very models of grammar and philology which were discerningly formulated for the service of scripture become the standard by which the linguistic configurations of the Qur'anic diction are appraised and justified. The strictures of authentication adhered to by readers predicated an implicit rejection of the abstract inquisitiveness practised by these linguists. And therein lies the history of the genesis of Arabic linguistic thought which this article will attempt to expound upon. ‮ٳن المتٲمل في تاريخ النحو العربي سوف يجد ٲن مناهج القراء تجاه الدراسات اللغوية کانت مبنية على خدمة کتاب الله عز وجل ٳذ کان تطور هذه الدراسات مرتبطا ارتباطا وثيقا بهذا الکتاب العزيز. ومن هذا المنطلق وضع القراء ٲصولا لٳحکام نظام النقط والٳعجام، وٲلَّفوا الرسائل في الوقف والابتداء، واعتنوا باختلاف المصاحف، کما ٲنهم جمعوا بين وجوه القراءات وعللها.‬ ‮وکان الهدف المنشود لهذه الجهود المبارکة هو توثيق النص القرءاني والحفاظ على ٲلفاظه الشريفة کما ٲنزل على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فبفضل القرآن الکريم ازدهرت الدراسات اللغوية. وهذا المقال يتناول مساهمة القراء الکوفيين في ٳنشاء هذه الدراسات بالٳشارة ٳلى الدور الٳيجابي الذي لعبوه في خدمة کتاب الله العزيز.‬},

A comparative analysis of the two libraries’ holdings in law, theology, philosophy, literature, and Quranic exegesis reveals that the late manuscript tradition was overwhelmingly focused on a small number of curriculum texts and extensive commentaries on them, while ignoring most of the works that we today consider the classics of these fields. Only in the early twentieth century were these classics rediscovered and popularized through print. Further, the vast majority of the printed works in the two libraries was produced in Egypt, but they also contained significant numbers of works from Istanbul, Iran, and India. Books printed in Europe, however, were nearly absent.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It explores expressions of~social conflict through the features of rhetorical focal points, silence,~communication at a distance, and the incongruity between fine gifts and~tense situations. The discussion examines social conflict by following the~development of main characters in other stories. These features of gift~exchange stories suggest an interest in emotional experience, and the~relationships among different stories about the same person imply an~interest in character development.

The fragments are today spread out in more than seventy libraries and private collections worldwide, and there is an ongoing effort to document and catalog all extant fragments. We explore three levels of extraction of catalog data from digital images of the fragments. First, images should be captured in a way that permits standardized automatic processing. Second, the images can be processed to detect elements such as image foreground, regions of written text, and lines of the text, thereby allowing for the automatic assignment of conventional catalog measurements. Third, modern computer-vision tools and statistical inference techniques may be used to identify fragments that might originate from the same original codex. Such matched fragments, commonly referred to as ‘joins’, were heretofore identified manually by experts, and presumably only a small fraction of existing joins have been discovered to date. Overall, we present what might be the first effort to address all three levels successfully within a large-scale project, detailing the various design choices and describing the techniques and algorithms used for the Cairo Genizah digitization project.},

Conflict resolution, the actors involved therein and whether the process took place in an institutional framework or in a more informal environment all inform us regarding changing power relations in the province. The effect of shifting power dynamics between members of the local Egyptian elite and the incoming Muslim rulers as well as the effect this had on social organization, the position of local elites and their relations with their indigenous constituencies and the authorities will be discussed. The paper also considers what this says about modifications in Egyptian elite composition and how these modifications relate to developments at the caliphal center. Finally, the question of how the role of local elites as arbitrators can be connected to their position vis-à-vis the Egyptian population on the one hand and the empire’s political center on the other is examined.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

New visual languages have been created for information display which exploit the computer's unique ability to render dynamic and three-dimensional typography. These languages demonstrate that the use of three dimensional form, expressive movement, visual focus and layering, in harmony with human perceptual abilities, improve navigation and contextual understanding of complex written documents. This thesis shows that graphic displays can be combined with physical interfaces to create interactions with purely typographic information that are rich, tactile and humane.},

The book explores the relationship between literacy, orality and memory in classical antiquity, not only from the point of view of antiquity, but also from that of modern cognitive psychology. It examines the contemporary as well as the ancient debate about how the writing tools we possess interact and affect the product, why they should do so and how the tasks required of memory change and develop with literacy's increasing output and evoking technologies.},

It points to how social history's emphasis on the depth, breadth, and braided nature of historical experience has helped inform writing on the senses and considers some of the methodological and conceptual questions and concerns arising from histories of the senses.

  abstract = {As response to climate change becomes an ever present issue, considerations of human-environment interactions in the past have moved beyond deterministic notions of climatically driven cycles of social expansion and collapse to more complex examinations of anthropogenic effects upon environments, as well as the transformative effects environmental change has upon human societies. The entanglement between these processes may be explored through a number of theoretical frameworks, including Niche Construction Theory (NCT) and other notions of human resilience. The Valley of Kashmir in the northernmost region of South Asia presents an opportunity for examining a number of these processes. This paper aims to synthesise past archaeological and Holocene palaeoclimate data, as well as review past interpretations of human responses to climate factors in Kashmir. Arguments are raised for new theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding human-environment interactions in the valley, based on recent studies from Kashmir and adjacent regions. These approaches aim to address gaps in understanding arising from poorly resolved environmental records or uncritical integration of archaeological and palaeoclimate data. Some early conclusions may be drawn as to ways in which differentiated land use patterns across the valley and adjacent mountain zones would have allowed for long term patterns of adjustment and reorganisation as a response to climate pressures. New preliminary data that has the potential for exploring some of these processes in the valley is also presented.},

  abstract = {When data consist of grouped observations or clusters, and there is a risk that measurements within the same group are not independent, group-specific random effects can be added to a regression model in order to account for such within-group associations. Regression models that contain such group-specific random effects are called mixed-effects regression models, or simply mixed models. Mixed models are a versatile tool that can handle both balanced and unbalanced datasets and that can also be applied when several layers of grouping are present in the data; these layers can either be nested or crossed. In linguistics, as in many other fields, the use of mixed models has gained ground rapidly over the last decade. This methodological evolution enables us to build more sophisticated and arguably more realistic models, but, due to its technical complexity, also introduces new challenges. This volume brings together a number of promising new evolutions in the use of mixed models in linguistics, but also addresses a number of common complications, misunderstandings, and pitfalls. Topics that are covered include the use of huge datasets, dealing with non-linear relations, issues of cross-validation, and issues of model selection and complex random structures. The volume features examples from various subfields in linguistics. The book also provides R code for a wide range of analyses.},

A better apprehension of the creative process involved in composing the Croniken is essential for the interpretation and understanding of the purpose and intended audience of the text. Furthermore, it gives an insight into the historiographical activities in the ‘peripheral’ bailiwicks of the Teutonic Order. Computational techniques, in this case John Burrows’ tried-and-tested Delta method, play an invaluable role in both the solution of these issues as well as in pointing in the direction of new enquiries. Here, the Delta method was used to create a walking window, only 2,000 words in length, across the entire chronicle. Despite the small sample size, chosen because in the present case, a finer granularity and precision in detecting the shifts in authorial styles was as important as reliability, Delta was able to pick out distinct parts of the chronicle, some as short as just \&gt;500 words.},

He explores the interaction between social, political, and cultural change in the Middle East and northern Africa and the development of a modern Arabic literary tradition. From the early nineteenth century through World War I, the Western genres of poetry, the novel, short story, and drama reached various parts of the Arabic-speaking world. Starkey discusses the resultant evolution of Arabic literature in separate sections on poetry, prose writing, and the theatre in Egypt, the Levant, Iraq, and northern Africa, from early contact through the emergence of women's literary voices in the 1960s to contemporary writers.Arabic terms are presented in transcription, and an extensive bibliography provides suggestions for further reading. Modern Arabic Literature is the perfect introduction for readers interested in the contemporary Middle East or in comparative, colonial, world, or modern literature.},

Breaking free of the heuristic constraints imposed on Mamluk studies by the paradigm of the political elite as defined by the normative exclusivism of elite military slavery—the so-called Mamluk system—it demonstrates that apparent dynastic attitudes were no mere façade for that system but rather powerful representations of the Mamluk version of a long-standing regional tradition of socio-political organisation: the military patronage state. It is argued here that this tradition, with its focus on military leadership, patronage ties, household bonds, and unstable devolved authorities, coalesced between 1279 and 1382 in Qalāwūnid leadership over and monopolisation of Syro-Egyptian societies.},

  abstract = {The chronological reordering of the Qur'an remains one of the main entrance gates to the Muslim sacred text for researchers today. However, if chronology produces a strong sense of coherence by providing both an organising principle and a narrative context, its historical accuracy is difficult to assess. Recurrent criticism points to its dependence on traditional materials, the circularity of its argumentation, and the inability to appreciate, and account for, the present state of the Qur'anic text. This article engages these questions through a close reading of one of the most influential chronological reorderings, that of the Geschichte des Qorâns by Nöldeke and Schwally, taking the different versions of this seminal text into consideration so as to explore its assumptions, methodology and originality. Particular attention is paid to the textual impact of this linear reading on the Qur'anic text and to the inherent difficulties encountered in any chronological arrangement of the Muslim scripture.},

  abstract = {Parole sans contexte évident ni trame narrative, le texte fondateur de l’islam ne dévoile pas aisément ses origines. Cette thèse examine un code de lecture particulier qui a pour effet de contextualiser le texte sacré de l’islam dans ce qu’on imagine avoir été son contexte premier. La lecture chronologique consiste à déterminer l’inscription temporelle de chaque sourate ou énoncé coranique par rapport, d’une part, aux autres énoncés et, d’autre part, à la carrière prophétique de Muḥammad. En (ré-)introduisant une dimension temporelle et narrative, l’interprétation du Coran est facilitée. Ce dernier est ainsi en mesure de raconter, sinon son histoire, du moins une histoire. La chronologie coranique structure à la fois l’exégèse musulmane prémoderne et la recherche universitaire occidentale sur le Coran. Dans cette thèse, nous examinons ces deux domaines de production de savoir, non pas en opposition l’un avec l’autre mais comme deux moments de la réception du texte coranique. Cette approche inclusive permet, à travers l’étude d’une problématique spécifique, d’entamer une réflexion sur les convergences et les divergences entre l’érudition islamique et la recherche occidentale. Notre point de départ et fil conducteur est la liste chronologique des sourates, qui circule dans la Tradition musulmane avant d’être reprise et retravaillée par des universitaires occidentaux. La quête de la séquence originelle du Coran a engendré des débats autant parmi les exégètes que dans la recherche historico-critique. Nous retraçons ces débats et portons une attention particulière à la « textualité » du Coran, qui en fait un texte particulièrement difficile à ancrer dans un contexte.},

The chronological importance of eclipses to present-day historians is well illustrated by the chronicles investigated, particularly where they note the death of a ruler or other historical event. Since the exact date of an eclipse can be computed these observations allow the precise date of the event to be established.},

In agreement with the traditional theories proposed by soviet scholars and defended, in another context, by Wittfogel, it is usually assumed that a strong, long-term association exists between the management of this irrigation system and some form of centralized political power system. By adopting an integrated approach, we will examine an alternative history of the emergence and growth of Samarkand and the link between water management and socio-political power. In the first part we will focus on the archaeological evidence pertaining to the construction of the Dargom, the primary canal of Samarkand and suggest that it is not necessarily the result of a short-term (or fixed) master plan or linked to a strong central political power. In the second part we will consider the nonirrigated grasslands surrounding the oasis and show that the socio-political structures of the oasis cannot be understood without a more systemic approach. The paper is based on the results of an ongoing project to survey the Middle Zeravshan Valley systematically initiated by the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan in collaboration with various international teams (see acknowledgements).},

  abstract = {The widespread availability of digitized premodern textual sources – together with increasingly sophisticated means for their manipulation – has brought enormous practical benefits to scholars whose work relies upon reference to their contents. While great progress has been made with the construction of ever more comprehensive database systems and archives, far more remains not only possible but also realistically achievable in the near future. This paper discusses some of the key challenges faced, and progress made towards solving them, in the context of a widely used open digital platform attempting to expand the range of digitized sources available while simultaneously increasing the scope of meaningful tasks that can be performed with them computationally. This paper aims to suggest how seemingly simple human-mediated additions to the digitized historical record – when combined with the power of digital systems to repeatedly perform mechanical tasks at enormous scales – quickly lead to transformative changes in the feasible scope of computational analysis of premodern writing.},

  abstract = {Text reuse in early Chinese transmitted texts is extensive and widespread, often reflecting complex textual histories involving repeated transcription, compilation, and editing spanning many centuries and involving the work of multiple authors and editors. In this study, a fully automated method of identifying and representing complex text reuse patterns is presented, and the results evaluated by comparison to a manually compiled reference work. The resultant data are integrated into a widely used and publicly available online database system with browse, search, and visualization functionality. These same results are then aggregated to create a model of text reuse relationships at a corpus level, revealing patterns of systematic reuse among groups of texts. Lastly, the large number of reuse instances identified make possible the analysis of frequently observed string substitutions, which are observed to be strongly indicative of partial synonymy between strings.},

Temur's authority was based on the Turko-Mongolian concept of leadership based on charisma, which represents one of the forms of legitimate domination in history. He also linked himself genealogically to Chinggis Khan, the founder of the Mongol empire. Although Temur did not hesitate to invoke Islamic legality whenever it was to his advantage to do so, Temur generally favoured the yasa over the sharia, the Islamic law. The Timurid state was predominantly military in character. It was based on a tribal military elite and supported by nomadic cavalry forces. The upsurge in cultural activity in Iran and Central Asia under Timurid patronage coincided roughly with the Renaissance in Europe; historians of Timurid art and culture dubbed it as the Timurid renaissance.},

  abstract = {Mushaf (read with "s" and "h" separately) is what Muslims call the physical body of the Quran, its pages, binding, and print. In contrast to earlier works on the holy book of Muslims, in my dissertation I shift from studying the Quranic text exclusively as message to its corporeal existence as an object in the hands of its manufacturers and users in Egypt, treating its production and consumption as meaning-making processes. I approach materiality of the Quran—the corporeal and electronic medium of the text—as a place for tracking transformations of religious authority, agency, knowledge and Muslim practice in the context of changing technologies of text production. By looking at different media forms (manuscript, print, and digital devices) that disseminate the text of the Quran, I follow tensions existing between a manufactured object, tradition, and practical religious experience among Muslims in Egypt. I treat material carrier of the Quran as an object that mediates between institutionalized authority epitomized by the University of al-Azhar (the oldest religious institution in the Middle East) that controls Quranic production, markets of publishing houses that manufacture printed and electronic "Qurans," and socially and economically diversified public consumers of the holy word in Egypt and beyond. Egypt is not the only potentate on the Muslim religious publishing market; highlighting the materiality of the Quranic text allows me to track the connections and tensions that arise between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, a new competitor in the production of Qurans. Through this project, I show how the Quran as an object participates in configuring social ties both locally and transnationally.},

Following that, we present an experimental tool for extracting and classifying citation contexts in humanities journal articles. This tool reports the bibliographic information about each reference, as well as three features about its context(s): frequency, location-in-document, and polarity. We found that extraction was highly successful (above 85\%) for three of the four journals, and statistics for the three citation figures were broadly consistent with previous research. We conclude by noting several limitations of the sentiment classifier and suggesting future areas for refinement.},

Using network analysis and a large prosopographic database, this article approaches this question from four perspectives: the marriage network of political elites, the backgrounds of chief ministers, the composition of the capital elite during three time slices, and the makeup of the provincial elite. Despite important continuities in the elite marriage network's basic structure, there were also significant discontinuities. Between the seventh and eighth centuries, Luoyang emerged as a secondary political center, and Luoyang-based families—including so-called “marriage-ban” clans—acquired a renewed significance, partly at the expense of old southern clans, whose political significance declined over the course of the dynasty. In addition, the political divide between capital and provinces grew over time, culminating in the ninth century with capital-based men occupying nearly all significant provincial posts and provincials serving only locally and in second-tier offices.},

Jack Tannous argues that key to understanding these dramatic religious transformations are ordinary religious believers, often called "the simple" in late antique and medieval sources. Largely agrarian and illiterate, these Christians outnumbered Muslims well into the era of the Crusades, and yet they have typically been invisible in our understanding of the Middle East's history. What did it mean for Christian communities to break apart over theological disagreements that most people could not understand? How does our view of the rise of Islam change if we take seriously the fact that Muslims remained a demographic minority for much of the Middle Ages? In addressing these and other questions, Tannous provides a sweeping reinterpretation of the religious history of the medieval Middle East. This provocative book draws on a wealth of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic sources to recast these conquered lands as largely Christian ones whose growing Muslim populations are properly understood as converting away from and in competition with the non-Muslim communities around them. --},

Unable to found schools for their clergy, they needed alternative methods to provide ideological formation. This paper argues that the Miaphysite leaders identified the exegesis of the Psalms, the quintessence of the scriptures and the heart of the daily liturgy, as a key means not only of shaping their community\&apos;s religious beliefs but also of addressing larger political issues. Their chosen exegete was Daniel of Salah who in \emph{c}.542 produced a Psalm commentary in homiletic form which addressed numerous issues of contemporary relevance. His response to Christological controversy is touched upon, but the focus is on his development of Miaphysite imperial ideology. Previous historians have usually argued that the Miaphysites demonstrated great loyalty to the institution and person of the emperor, despite persecution at their hands. This paper argues to the contrary that while Daniel accepted the need for political allegiance to the emperors, he denies them any role as special mediators of divine revelation or faith. The true king is the crucified Christ, in whose image the mind or reason of each human was created, and it is the guidance of these which is to be followed in religious matters.},

Prior to the advent of the user-generated content (UGC) technology, creative works on the Internet were produced by one or several identifiable authors. The advent of the UGC technology has enabled the active authorial participation of Internet users. This has made it possible for massively collaborative works on the Internet to mushroom where numerous authors’ contributions are incrementally merged into an extensive single work. The concept of an ‘author’ under copyright law is premised on the basis that a work has one or several finite authors. Many UGC works defy this traditional mode of creating works. Taking Malaysian copyright law as the focal point of this study, the research examines whether the concept of an ‘author’ as defined in the Malaysian Copyright Act 1987 is sufficient to address the authorship issue in the light of the UGC technology. It concludes that the current concept of an ‘author’ in the Act is ill-equipped to accommodate Internet-based collaborations. It recommends the introduction of the concept of a ‘deemed author’ in copyright law and suggests that the status of a ‘deemed author’ be conferred on the entity who controls and determines the configuration of the resulting work.},

  abstract = {Scholarship has argued that the Ottoman \emph{timar} system was an efficient way to provide military forces in a non-monetized economy. As the state granted its sources of revenue to \emph{timariot}s in return for military service, it was financially relieved of the need to pay the expenses of the cavalry. Several documents so far neglected by scholars and evidencing the practice of cash loans to timariots during military campaigns prove otherwise. This paper analyzes the process of the generation of timariots’ disposable income in the framework of actor-network theory. It is argued that the granting of loans demonstrated an attempt to regulate the cash flow of the timariot’s income during campaigns, which was necessitated by problems of transforming tax revenues into disposable form. In the light of documents evidencing cash loans, it is further argued that cash loans reflect the vulnerability of the Ottoman timar system.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the question of the chronology of the Qur'ān has become a heated topic among scholars. As it is known, the Qur'ān does not follow any declared chronological order and the traditional division of sūras in Meccan and Medinan is mostly based on the traditional accounts about the biography of Muḥammad. However, the real value of these traditions appears to be more exegetical than historical. In fact, in many cases the accounts about Muḥammad's life appear to be the result of logical speculations about the Qur'ānic text itself, rather than the transmission of historical records. The possible non-historicity of the accounts on which the traditional chronological arrangement of the sūras is based would evidently mine the whole system of categorization. Despite this evident methodological difficulty, many scholars have continued to accept the traditional view and thus to read the Qur'ān chronologically. In the present study, I will draw the attention on the case of the story of Ḏū l-Qarnayn (Q 18:83-102) and on an interesting problem of chronology implied by its possible dependence on a Syriac work composed after 629 CE.},

It has largely displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatting system, in many Unix installations which use both for different purposes. It is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially in the form of LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other macro packages. TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books with minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time (together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces). TeX is a free software, which made it accessible to a wide range of users.},

The APD presents texts in five levels that account for the peculiarities of the Arabic script system and the scribal practices. The first level provides a faithful diplomatic edition of the text as found in the document. The following levels document four steps of editorial interventions. On the second level, lines of characters are broken into single words. On the third level, lacking diacritical dots are supplied. On the fourth level, Arabic vowel signs are added, providing a full phonological representation. On the fifth level, a scientific Latin transliteration is given. Each element of the fifth level is connected to a lexicon and a list of grammatical forms. All levels contain variant readings and editorial remarks. At present, the APD contains 1,806 full-text documents and is freely accessible (http://www.naher-osten.lmu.de/apd).},

And every day cultural institutions and private bodies add thousands of new cultural works to the digital sphere. Mass digitization is forming new central nexuses of knowledge and new ways of engaging with that knowledge. What at first glance appears to be a simple act of digitization (a transformation of singular books from boundary objects to open sets of data), at closer examination reveals a complex process teeming with diverse political, legal, and cultural investments. This book argues that mass digitization has become a global cultural political project. It offers an in-depth examination of mass digitization of cultural memory in the West and beyond. It suggests a new approach to the study of digital cultural memory archives, proposing to understand mass digitization not as neutral technical processes, but rather as distinct subpolitical processes that build new kinds of archives and new ways of interacting with these archives. And it seeks to develop a critical theoretical framework for understanding the new archival apparatuses and the politics and memory dynamics they give rise to"--},

The Ottomans' ambitions covered the whole of the Maghrib. The weak political situation of the Maghrib in the ninth/fifteenth century favoured the Spanish, who little by little between 911/1505 and 917/1511 occupied the major points on its Mediterranean coast. Although the regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli had been created by the same foreign army, their political development was very different. It gave rise to two contrasting models of sovereignty. Whilst Algiers lived under the grip of the militia, Tunis and later, Tripoli moved towards the constitution of a hereditary monarchy.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

  abstract = {If historians of the Middle East have turned their attention to the environment rather later than those in other subfields, a recent crop of books indicates that a new generation of scholars has spent much productive time considering environmental histories of other geographies. The books reviewed in this essay stand out for their insistence on examining Middle Eastern environments as both ecological facts and representational spaces. Taken in concert, they indicate the vibrancy of environmental history in the field. Moreover, their careful attention to methodology and creative use of sources opens up spaces for new investigations of politics, culture, and religion as mediated through environmental management and representation. Following on the recent work of Diana K. Davis, Edmund Burke III, and others, these historians have marshaled environmental, climatological, epidemiological, biological, and geological data for historical argument. Thus, the resulting works situate themselves deeply within their respective historiographic narratives, yet also interrupt, redelineate, and unsettle those narrative assumptions. At its best, the so-called “environmental turn” in the history of the Middle East represents not an intellectual fashion, but rather a major methodological shift that involves a reframing of our understanding of the formation of the field.},

After analysing various kinds of internal and external evidence in favour of and against the authenticity of the letter, a modern stylometric method is applied in order to examine whether internal linguistic evidence allows one to definitely settle the debate.The findings of this analysis tend to contradict received opinion among modern scholars, affirming the authenticity of Pliny’s letter, and suggest instead the presence of large amounts of interpolation inside the text of the letter, since its stylistic behaviour appears highly different from that of the rest of Book X.},

To this end, DocuSky provides tools for a scholar to download material from the Web and prepare (annotating, building metadata) her material, a one-click function to build a full-text searchable database, and tools for analysis and visualization. DocuSky advocates the separation of digital content and tools. Being an open platform, it encourages IT developers to build tools to suit scholars’ needs, and it has already incorporated several popular Web resources and external tools into its environment. Interoperability is ensured through the format DocuXML. In addition to describing the design principles of DocuSky, we will show its main features, together with several important tools and examples. DocuSky was originally developed for Sinological studies. We are enriching it to work in other languages.},

Thus, the temporal distribution of unrecovered coin hoards is an excellent proxy for the intensity of internal warfare. We use this relationship to resolve a long-standing controversy in Roman history. Depending on who was counted in the early Imperial censuses (adult males or the entire citizenry including women and minors), the Roman citizen population of Italy either declined, or more than doubled, during the first century BCE. This period was characterized by a series of civil wars, and historical evidence indicates that high levels of sociopolitical instability are associated with demographic contractions. We fitted a simple model quantifying the effect of instability (proxied by hoard frequency) on population dynamics to the data before 100 BCE. The model predicts declining population after 100 BCE. This suggests that the vigorous growth scenario is highly implausible.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is powerful.There aren't many highly cooperative species--but they nearly cover the planet. Ants alone account for a quarter of all animal matter. Yet the human capacity to work together leaves every other species standing.We organize ourselves into communities of hundreds of millions of individuals, inhabit every continent, and send people into space. Human beings are nature's greatest team players. And the truly astounding thing is, we only started our steep climb to the top of the rankings--overtaking wasps, bees, termites and ants--in the last 10,000 years. Genetic evolution can't explain this anomaly. Something else is going on. How did we become the ultrasocial animal?In his latest book, the evolutionary scientist Peter Turchin (War and Peace and War) solves the puzzle using some astonishing results in the new science of Cultural Evolution. The story of humanity, from the first scattered bands of Homo sapiens right through to the greatest empires in history, turns out to be driven by a remorseless logic. Our apparently miraculous powers of cooperation were forged in the fires of war. Only conflict, escalating in scale and severity, can explain the extraordinary shifts in human society--and society is the greatest military technology of all.Seen through the eyes of Cultural Evolution, human history reveals a strange, paradoxical pattern. Early humans were much more egalitarian than other primates, ruthlessly eliminating any upstart who wanted to become alpha male. But if human nature favors equality, how did the blood-soaked god kings of antiquity ever manage to claim their thrones? And how, over the course of thousands of years, did they vanish from the earth, swept away by a reborn spirit of human equality? Why is the story of human justice a chronicle of millennia-long reversals? Once again, the science points to just one explanation: war created the terrible majesty of kingship, and war obliterated it.Is endless war, then, our fate? Or might society one day evolve beyond it? There's only one way to answer that question. Follow Turchin on an epic journey through time, and discover something that generations of historians thought impossible: the hidden laws of history itself.},

The different needs of scholars, coupled with the constant search for an effective price/result ratio and the local availability of technical skills, have led to a remarkable fragmentation: publishing solutions range from simple HTML pages produced using the TEI stylesheets (or the TEI Boilerplate software) to very complex frameworks based on CMS and SQL search engines. Researchers of the Digital Vercelli Book project started looking into a simple, user-friendly solution and eventually decided to build their own: EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) has been under development since about 2010 and has turned into a flexible tool that can be used to create a web-based digital edition starting from transcription files encoded in TEI XML. This paper describes why this tool was created, how it works, and developments planned for the future.},

Fieldwork reports by linguists and anthropologists in three continents provide concrete examples of overcoming barriers -- ethical, practical and conceptual -- in digital documentation projects.

Al-Mutawakkil ended the Miḥna as one part of his broader effort to establish his position as sovereign and independent of the individuals and structures that had carried over from al-Wāthiq's reign. Eliminating the Miḥna was one strategy deployed in undermining and eliminating the "kingmakers" who had placed him on the throne. He correctly surmised that if left in place these would impede his position and ultimately control him.},

  abstract = {This book demonstrates how quantitative methods for text analysis can successfully combine with qualitative methods in the study of different disciplines of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). The book focuses on learning about the evolution of ideas of HSS disciplines through a distant reading of the contents conveyed by scientific literature, in order to retrieve the most relevant topics being debated over time. Quantitative methods, statistical techniques and software packages are used to identify and study the main subject matters of a discipline from raw textual data, both in the past and today. The book also deals with the concept of quality of life of words and aims to foster a discussion about the life cycle of scientific ideas. Textual data retrieved from large corpora pose interesting challenges for any data analysis method and today represent a growing area of research in many fields. New problems emerge from the growing availability of large databases and new methods are needed to retrieve significant information from those large information sources. This book can be used to explain how quantitative methods can be part of the research instrumentation and the "toolbox" of scholars of Humanities and Social Sciences. The book contains numerous examples and a description of the main methods in use, with references to literature and available software. Most of the chapters of the book have been written in a non-technical language for HSS researchers without mathematical, computer or statistical backgrounds.},

Saikaku Ihara (井原西鶴) (c. 1642–93) is one of the most famous writers of the Edo period (1603–1868) in Japan. Saikaku's works are known for their significance for developing Japanese novels today. For a long time, researchers have tried to identify Saikaku’s works by investigating the history, content, format, and other features. However, it remained unclear which works were really written by Saikaku. Meanwhile, the potential of quantitative analysis of textual data has dramatically advanced. To resolve Saikaku’s authorship problem, our laboratory worked with Saikaku researchers to develop a database of works attributed to Saikaku. Based on these new capabilities, we examined Yorozu no humihougu (万の文反古) using quantitative analysis. In this study, we compared Yorozu no humihougu (万の文反古) and Kousyoku ichidai otoko (好色一代男), which has been verified to be a work of Saikaku. We examined six grammatical categories using principal component analysis where significant differences were found. Yorozu no humihougu (万の文反古) was revealed to be characterized as having a higher frequency of verbs and a lower frequency of particles than in Kousyoku ichidai otoko (好色一代男).},

It argues that the presence of Khurāsānī governors and troops in Armenia challenges the idea that Armenia was separated or isolated from the broader concerns of the Caliphate. After a brief introduction to the ostikanate, the chapter discusses the Khurāsānī governors chronologically along five main periods: (1) the ʿAbbāsid Revolution; (2) the Battle of Bagrewand in 775; (3) Hārūn al-Rashīd and al-Amīn; (4) the fourth fitna; (5) the rise of Transoxanian ostikans. This discussion demonstrates that ʿAbbāsid rule relied heavily on Khurāsānī ostikans and troops in Armenia. It further establishes the caliphal north as a region where ʿAbbāsid power and at times intra-Khurāsānī conflict played out.},

From 2003 to 2014 approximately 90\% of United Nations member countries ratified the FCTC. We hypothesized that communication between tobacco control advocates on GLOBALink, a 7000-member online communication forum in existence from 1992 to 2012, would be associated with the timing of treaty ratification. We further hypothesized dynamic network influences such that external influence decreased over time, internal influence increased over time, and the role of opinion leader countries varied over time. In addition we develop two concepts: Susceptibility and influence that uncover the micro-level dynamics of network influence. Statistical analyses lend support to the influence of co-subscriptions on GLOBALink providing a conduit for inter-country influences on treaty ratification and some support for the dynamic hypotheses. Analyses of susceptibility and infection indicated particularly influential countries. These results have implications for the study of policy diffusion as well as dynamic models of behavior change.},

Some others are to make the fiction more ‘real’ or to present ideas about a character by using a name with certain meanings or associations to manipulate the reader’s expectations. A description of the functions of a certain name in a certain text becomes relevant when the researcher can point out how it compares to the functions of other names and names in other texts. The article describes how research into names in literary texts needs a quantitative approach to reach a higher level of relevancy. To get a first impression of what may be normal in literary texts, a corpus of twenty-two Dutch and twenty-two English novels and ten translations into the other language in both sets were gathered. The occurrences of all names in these novels have been tagged for those data categories that seemed useful for the literary stylistic research planned. Some first results of the statistics are presented and the use of the approach is illustrated by means of an analysis of the use of geographical names in the Dutch novel Boven is het stil by Gerbrand Bakker and its English translation by David Colmer, The Twin. In the evaluation of the results, special attention is paid to the status of currently available digital tools for named entity recognition and classification, followed by a wish-list for the tools that this kind of research really needs.},

However, this type of narrative information is of little direct use within a machine-readable context due to its unstructured nature. This article explores the possibilities and limitations of named-entity recognition (NER) and term extraction (TE) to mine such unstructured metadata for meaningful concepts. These concepts can be used to leverage otherwise limited searching and browsing operations, but they can also play an important role to foster Digital Humanities research. To catalyze experimentation with NER and TE, the article proposes an evaluation of the performance of three third-party entity extraction services through a comprehensive case study, based on the descriptive fields of the Smithsonian Cooper–Hewitt National Design Museum in New York. To cover both NER and TE, we first offer a quantitative analysis of named entities retrieved by the services in terms of precision and recall compared with a manually annotated gold-standard corpus, and then complement this approach with a more qualitative assessment of relevant terms extracted. Based on the outcomes of this double analysis, the conclusions present the added value of entity extraction services, but also indicate the dangers of uncritically using NER and/or TE, and by extension Linked Data principles, within the Digital Humanities. All metadata and tools used within the article are freely available, making it possible for researchers and practitioners to repeat the methodology. By doing so, the article offers a significant contribution towards understanding the value of entity recognition and disambiguation for the Digital Humanities.},

Using a wealth of archival and narrative sources, including medical treatises, hagiographies, and travelers' accounts, as well as recent scientific research, Nükhet Varlik demonstrates how plague interacted with the environmental, social, and political structures of the Ottoman Empire from the late medieval through the early modern era. The book argues that the empire's growth transformed the epidemiological patterns of plague by bringing diverse ecological zones into interaction and by intensifying the mobilities of exchange among both human and non-human agents. Varlik maintains that persistent plagues elicited new forms of cultural imagination and expression, as well as a new body of knowledge about the disease. In turn, this new consciousness sharpened the Ottoman administrative response to the plague, while contributing to the makings of an early modern state"--},

This article focuses on what appears in all but name to be the mālikāne-dīvānī system as it was applied in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, as revealed in its provincial cadastres. The origin of this system in northern Syria remains unclear. There is little doubt, however, that the intent of the system was to further the state's interest. This it did by granting the state the opportunity not only to increase its representation in the countryside but, at the same time, to check rival revenue interests that might otherwise have remained unopposed.},

Through focus on an iqṭāʿ (military holding) in the northern Syrian heartland that the Mamluks awarded the Dulgadir leadership-the award itself betokening the strength of the Dulgadir and the potential threat that the Mamluks sought to appease-, the article goes on to examine the dynamics of the Dulgadir-Mamluk relationship and the part that the Dulgadir played within the Mamluk-Ottoman rivalry, demonstrating that the Dulgadir were wily, worthy, and capable opponents of both the Mamluks and the Ottomans, and that the Mamluks and Ottomans used similar tactics in dealing with the Dulgadir. In returning to an in-depth examination of this Dulgadir-Mamluk iqṭāʿ, the article establishes the territorial extent of Dulgadir power and the tribal character of the frontier that separated Dulgadir territory from the Mamluk domain proper, concluding that Mamluk control of the northern Syrian heartland, on the eve of the Ottoman conquest, was already severely weekened as a result of tribal encroachment. The Ottomans, within a few years of the conquest, struck a blow against the Dulgadir in their decision to abolish this iqṭāʿ in northern Syria. Even earlier, however, they had abolished the iqṭāʿs of the Mamluks themselves in what had become the Ottoman Sanjag of Aleppo, but they continue to maintain, until mid-century, at least some of the old Mamluk iqṭāʿ granted to tribesmen, until mid-century, at least some of the old Mamluk iqṭāʿs granted to tribesmen, thus the ultimate demise of the Mamluk iqṭāʿ in this area.},

In both al-Andalus and the Maghrib, the cities experienced substantial growth. In the Maghrib, the great urban event was the founding of Marrakesh in 463/1070 by the new Almoravid dynasty. In 399/1009, in spite of the apparent strength of the Ummayad caliphate, civil war broke out and the centralised caliphal state was torn into the various Taifas, which would last for the rest of that century and into the next.

Each of these stages bring their own challenges and considerations that need to be dealt with. The authors in each section present case studies and overviews of how each of these aspects might be dealt with. While technology is rapidly changing, the principles laid out in these chapters should serve as a guide for many years to come. The influence of the digital world on archaeology and cultural heritage will continue to shape these disciplines as advances in these technologies facilitate new lines of research. serif"{$>$}The book is divided into three sections covering acquisition, curation, and dissemination (the major life cycles of cultural heritage data). Acquisition is one of the fundamental challenges for practitioners in heritage and archaeology, and the chapters in this section provide a template that highlights the principles for present and future work that will provide sustainable models for digital documentation. Following acquisition, the next section highlights how equally important curation is as the future of digital documentation depends on it. Preservation of digital data requires preservation that can guarantee a future for generations to come. The final section focuses on dissemination as it is what pushes the data beyond the shelves of storage and allows the public to experience the past through these new technologies, but also opens new lines of investigation by giving access to these data to researchers around the globe. Digital technology promises significant changes in how we approach social sciences, cultural heritage, and archaeology. However, researchers must consider not only the acquisition and curation, but also the dissemination of these data to their colleagues and the public.Throughout the book, many of the authors have highlighted the usefulness of Structure from Motion (SfM) work for cultural heritage documentation; others the utility and excitement of crowdsourcing as a ‘citizen scientist’ tool to engage not only trained students and researchers, but also the public in the cyber-archaeology endeavor. Both innovative tools facilitate the curation of digital cultural heritage and its dissemination. Together with all the chapters in this volume, the authors will help archaeologists, researchers interested in the digital humanities and scholars who focus on digital cultural heritage to assess where the field is and where it is going.},

As a political ideology it was most successful in the period of the nationwide Egyptian struggle for independence in the early twentieth century, but its impact in particular among Coptic intellectuals is still great. In this essay, it is argued that Pharaonism is shaped in a remarkable degree by western Orientalism, and that its main historical tenets, such as the Copts\&apos; indebtedness to pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture or their anti-Greek nationalism, can no longer be maintained.},

  abstract = {The development of landscapes of the central part of the Middle-Volga region in the last 2500 years was a discontinuous process of the explosive growth of population and land utilization alternating with stages of depopulation and desolation. The periods of depopulation and transitions of cultures occurred at similar times to climate changes. Some cultures were associated with distinct climatic episodes, such as the association of the Dark Ages Cold Period with Hun, post Hun, Heraldic, and Khasarian times, and the Medival Warm Period with the time of Volga Bulgaria. A combination of archaeological and paleoecological analyses allowed us to reconstruct a sequence of landscape and land use changes in relation to the historical development of the region. The first millennium CE was a time of major changes in population, agricultural technologies, social structure, and settlement patterns in the forest-steppe zone. The MiddleVolga region underwent a transition from a non-populated, mainly-forested landscape of first centuries CE to a highly deforested agricultural landscape of the Volga Bulgarian state by the 11th century CE. Within several centuries, the landscape was transformed by shifting cultivation, wood and ore extraction, and the formation and expansion of pastures and road networks. The process of deforestation in the region was facilitated by the relatively warm climates of the Medieval Warm Period.},

The history of Islam in South-East Asia obviously cannot be understood without examining the component phenomena on a global scale. Throughout the processes of Islamic expansion a multitude of changes took place in the physical as well as mental topographies of the region. The Malay languages of the archipelago began to absorb the terminology of Islamic theology and law.},

Three experiments are reported. The first two serve to show that choice of the Croatian vs. Serbian variant is not the most important factor shaping frequency profiles of translations; rather, author-specific and other stylistic factors have a stronger impact. For the third experiment, a classifier is trained and its factors are analyzed to pinpoint variant-specific differences in the frequencies of word forms that are used in both variants. Our results show that a stylometric approach is useful in an empirical investigation of recurrent differences between different varieties and standard variants of BCS.},

  abstract = {"Ayyubid," "Mamluk," and "Ottoman" are the often only vaguely familiar political designations of the Middle and Late Islamic periods of Palestine. Together spanning over seven centuries, their rule of the region began under the leadership of the politically and militarily gifted Salah al-Din (d. 1193), who established the Ayyubid Dynasty, unifying the Muslim Levant and dealing with the Frankish states that had been founded by the Crusaders. Nearly a century later, a bloodless military coup brought the Mamluk Sultanate into being with its fascinating institution of importing slaves who were enculturated, educated, and trained in the military arts. The Sultanate was a novelty, representing the first time Mamluks succeeded in creating their own state. Incorporating Palestine into their Cairo-based empire, the Mamluk empire became what was then the longest living, autonomous Islamic state in Egypt, surpassed only by its successor, the Ottoman Sultanate. The Ottomans, who, like the Mamluks, were a military dynasty, swept through Palestine in 1516. In the first hundred years of their governance, some of Palestine's larger towns received Ottoman patronage. Suleiman the Magnificent stands out for the attention he showered on Jerusalem, beautifying the Dome of the Rock and repairing the town's walls and gates. Soon, however, the Ottomans lost interest in a region so distant from their capitol in Anatolia. Investment gave way to neglect, and for two centuries there was little governance emanating from the central administration. Tribal sheiks rose in the vacuum, and local autonomy characterized a fairly splintered region. Ottoman resurgence in the nineteenth century imposed a stronger, more involved government and ambitious projects with international scope: the Suez Canal (1869) and the Hijaz Railway (finished in 1908), whetting the interest of European powers. Britain terminated Ottoman rule at the conclusion of the first World War.},

Self-identified liberal professionals and semiprofessionals constitute the modern dance community at the end of this century which was reconstituted out of the 1960s counterculture. Feminists, environmentalists and "spiritual," the modern dance community, which identifies as left-wing or liberal, reflects the shoals of race on which the modern political culture of liberalism flounders: originally an Anglo-American group, the "white" ethnic dancers who now predominate in ECD celebrate the dance floor as an anti-materialist "safe" urban space at the same time as they bemoan the lack of people of color on the dance floor.

Only in the last few years have there been serious attempts to transcend these borders. The present volume examines turning points in historical thought in a variety of cultures. The essays in the first half of the book deal with fundamental reorientations in historical thinking in the pre-modern period since Antiquity, specifically in ancient Greece and China and in medieval Christian Europe, the Islamic world and again China. The essays all proceed from the premise that historical thought in none of these cultures was static but underwent profound changes over time. The essays in the second part deal with historical writing beginning with the professionalization of history in the nineteenth century. National history researched and composed around a master narrative constituted a major turning point in this period. Although the new paradigm emerged in the West, it was broadly accepted by historians throughout the world.in the twentieth century. Individual chapters deal with conceptions of scientific history in the West, a comparison of national histories in Japan, France, and the United States, and the invention of Chinese, African and Indian national histories; finally the critiques of the modern paradigm in postmodernist and postcolonial theory and a consideration of the shortcomings of these critiques.

Such associations, however, overlook manifold complexities of the era’s portrayal in classical Arabic literature, and this paper calls for a more nuanced reading of classical narratives of al-Jāhiliyya. Exploration of the word’s semantic shifts evidenced in Arabic lexicography and Qurʾānic exegesis between the third/ninth and seventh/ thirteenth centuries reveals that only after the fourth/tenth century did the now common Jāhiliyya stereotypes become virtually synonymous with pre-Islam. Via a survey of third/ninth century Arabic writings, this paper also explores how and why certain discourses articulated rather positive memories of pre-Islamic times.},

This paper will examine the curiously paradoxical views of al-Jāḥiẓ~by considering his opinions on non-Arabic books in the context of~scholarly debates in his contemporary Iraq. Al-Jāḥiẓ’s conception of such~books intersected debates regarding (a) the suitability of books to transmit~knowledge, (b) rivalries between Arabs and non-Arabs in early ʿAbbāsid~Iraq, and (c) the merits of translating scholarly writings from pre-Islamic~civilisations. Al-Jāḥiẓ’s opinions on these issues led him to develop a~particular conception of the ‘perfect book’ whereby he could unreservedly~praise his own writings and extol ʿAbbāsid literary culture, but at the same~time subordinate foreign literary cultures to the non-literate pre-Islamic Arabians. Al-Jāḥiẓ’s theories reveal that 3rd/9th-century Iraq had not yet~become entirely a ‘civilisation of the book’, and that conceptions of~language, ethnicity and knowledge influenced the formation of Muslim~bibliophilia.},

Originally designed for those working with pre-twentieth-century Chinese texts, MARKUS has developed into a multifunctional annotation platform that is particularly suited for the automated annotation, referencing, and visualization of named entities in modern and literary Chinese and premodern Korean texts, but many of its additional annotation features can be used to analyze and read texts in any language, as long as the electronic documents are encoded in the most common standard for language encoding, Unicode. Below I discuss the main goals and methodological features of MARKUS and the allied text comparison utility COMPARATIVUS. I will illustrate these with some examples of how MARKUS has been used in Chinese and Korean historical research.},

Modern Language Association of America, 2013) and Rybicki (2016), we have shifted the focus of our investigation away from style, in the macro-analytical sense, to period and its relation to gender-differentiable terminology. Doing so recognizes the limitations of approaches like Zeta and Delta, while simultaneously benefiting from their affordances. Accepting that one can never have too large or robust a data set for this type of macro-analytic case study, we attempt to build on the foundations set down by Hoover and Rybicki, analyzing gender markers across a selection of male and female authors, and doing so crucially with a concern for the evolution of gender markers over specified canonical literary periods.},

This article surveys the history of Chinese participation in Muslim book culture, beginning with a review of the history and general features of texts, in terms of their language and period of composition. The second part of the article provides a more nuanced analysis of texts that circulated in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries throughout China, on the study of Arabo-Persian languages.

These objects, which originated within an Islamic world that ranges from Western Europe to Indonesia and across more than 13 centuries (from the 8th up to the 21st century), share a distinctive relationship to the materials they are made of: their color, shape, texture and technique of production all convey meaning. Many of the objects included are functional as well as aesthetically refined, and their histories as objects that were gifted, sold, bought, modified, collected and displayed are explored in this volume.Drawing on the latest technical information and enhanced by texts from an international team of scholars, Ink, Silk \& Gold is an inviting introduction to the riches of the Islamic art collection at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and a window into a vibrant global culture.},

The heritage of the ancient Near East, based on the ethnical and historical conception of the Arameans (including the Chaldeans and the \emph{Ōturōyē} as well as the \emph{Ōrōmōyē}) since the times of the ancient empires was a very important element of the identity. Just as important to him was the historical legitimacy of the Orthodox Church as a group excluding other Aramaic-speaking Christians. This conception of identity was complex, dialectic, and multi-layered, comprising ethnic, historic, cultural, and religious elements. Not unlike modern people, he and the members of the Syriac Orthodox communities participated in different and overlapping cultures and identities throughout the Syriac Orthodox world. The Syriac Orthodox identity had been under polemical attack for a long time, against which both historical and theological answers were formulated over the centuries. At the same time, Michael can be a witness only for a certain group and a certain region. He speaks mainly for the Syriac-speaking regions of the Syriac Orthodox world and the clergy. Neither the Syriac Orthodox identity of Arabic speaking Syriac Orthodox Christians, for example in Takrit, nor the identities of laymen are of his concern.},

The historiography of disease in the Middle East developed from the late 1970s to the early 1990s envisioned a steady mortality from inevitable cycles of bubonic plague supposedly accepted with pious resignation by Ottoman Muslims. Focusing on the period from circa 1500 to 1800, the article advances three arguments. First, Ottoman Muslims sometimes did take action to escape or contain epidemics. Second, the region actually suffered from a variety of other infections that together had an equal or greater impact than bubonic plague. Third, shifting political, social, and environmental conditions—especially Little Ice Age climate fluctuations and population movements during the 17th century—played a major role in disease mortality and Ottoman demography.},

Virtually forgotten in India for hundreds of years and maligned when it was first discovered in the West, the Yoga Sutra has been elevated to its present iconic status--and translated into more than forty languages--only in the course of the past forty years. White retraces the strange and circuitous journey of this confounding work from its ancient origins down through its heyday in the seventh through eleventh centuries, its gradual fall into obscurity, and its modern resurgence since the nineteenth century. First introduced to the West by the British Orientalist Henry Thomas Colebrooke, the Yoga Sutra was revived largely in Europe and America, and predominantly in English. White brings to life the improbable cast of characters whose interpretations--and misappropriations--of the Yoga Sutra led to its revered place in popular culture today. Tracing the remarkable trajectory of this enigmatic work, White's exhaustively researched book also demonstrates why the yoga of India's past bears little resemblance to the yoga practiced today"--},

  abstract = {In many areas of the Near East the Late Roman period, in terms of population size, settlement density and levels of exploitation, marks a pre-modern high. The territorial expansion of Rome began in earnest in the second century BCE, and had its roots in the competitive aristocratic politics of the republic. The crisis of the mid-third century was surmounted, but it left emperors in no doubt that relations with the Persians had to be their first priority, and that major deployments anywhere other than the Persian front would depend on peace there. The Nabataean kingdom in what is now Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia was annexed in 106 to create the province of Arabia. The rise of Islam as it actually happened is comprehensible only in the context of the history of the Roman empire, a history that culminated in what James Howard-Johnston has evocatively dubbed the 'the last great war of Antiquity'.},

Yazdgerd III was made king by Rustam's aristocratic party, thus becoming the Sasanians' last ruler. It was a decidedly Iranian attitude that characterised the Sasanian image of the ruler and his qualities. The late Sasanian period was altogether a time of literary flowering, much of it commissioned or sponsored by the royal court. The Sasanian empire was also characterised by the magnitude and diversity of its religious groups and communities.

These have affected the Middle East and North Africa at a time when colonial and nation-state borders carved up the region, dividing environments that were once contained within single empires. Environmental history offers new lines of inquiry to assess the consequences of these transformations. Contrary to pervasive, often colonially derived, narratives of a self-induced environmental decline in the region, critical analyses from an environmental perspective facilitate critiques of such “declensionist paradigms.” Evaluating indicators of               longue durée               change alongside more short-term shifts in approaches to environmental management exposes the interests served by these narratives while demonstrating the suitability of local environmental practices to the particular ecological zones that characterize the region.},

Arguing that additional deliberation on what method means to us is now both appropriate and essential to the maturing discipline of digital humanities, in this article I discuss what digital methods have shown us about OED2 and Geoffrey Hill’s notoriously intertextual long poem The Triumph of Love (1998), both as an example and an illustration of one way of reflecting on these questions: a concept of digital method as tautology.},

This article presents the relational data model as a way of representing the structure of skaldic texts and their contextual environment. The relational data model raises both problems and possibilities for this type of project. The main problem addressed here is the representation of the syntagmatic structures of texts in a data model that is not intrinsically ordered. The advantages are also explored, including networked data editing and management, quantitative linguistic analysis, dynamic representation of the data, and the ability to extend the structure and reuse data for related projects without creating redundancy.},

  abstract = {The early Islamic conquests brought Byzantine/Sasanid rivalry to an abrupt end while bringing the Middle East into a single monetary exchange system and linking the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean under the aegis of a single imperial polity. For the Arabs, Sind was overwhelmingly important as a thoroughfare of the India trade, both overland and maritime. The Turks who established their Islamic empire beyond Sind in the fifth/eleventh century, like their pre-Islamic predecessors, are better designated as post-nomadic people, with origins in the steppes but no longer active practitioners of pastoral nomadism. Al-Biruni, in his Kitab al-Hind, dates the beginning of 'the days of the Turks' from 'the time when they seized power in Ghazna under the Samani dynasty, and sovereignty fell to Nasir al-Dawla Sabuktigin'. The Shansabani dynasty superseded the Ghaznavids in the second half of the twelfth century.},

This article draws on the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian to illustrate how the caliphate became an increasingly hostile environment for Christian landed lay elites, incentivizing powerful families to take roles in the state’s administration or within the church. Using examples from the Jacobite church, I argue that the state became increasingly involved in church governance, by publicly endorsing the patriarch and his ability to raise revenues from Christians, and by supporting him with state troops against rival clerics.},

We believe that knowledge should be in free circulation to benefit humankind, which means an equitable and vibrant economy to support publishing, instead of the prevailing capitalist hand-me-down system of Sisyphean economic sustainability. Readers and books have been forced into pirate libraries, while sales channels have been monopolised by the big Internet giants which exact extortionate fees from publishers. We have three proposals. First, publications should be free-at-the-point-of-reading under a variety of open intellectual property regimes. Second, they should become fully digital - in order to facilitate ready reuse, distribution, algorithmic and computational use. Finally, Open Source source software for publishing should be treated as public infrastructure, with sustained research and investment. The result of such robust infrastructures will mean lower costs for manufacturing and faster publishing lifecycles, so that publishers and publics will be more readily able to afford to invent new futures},

It documents new archival evidence for the scope of this textual tradition. The combination of digital textual and archival evidence provides important clues for building hypotheses for an expanded reception history of the Arabic text in Europe. Using corpora built in three languages—Castilian, Latin and French—it leverages stylometric analysis to explore the discursive communities in which the translations may have emerged and where they took on new meanings. The article puts medium-scale stylometry into practice in the field of comparative literature and translation studies for the exploration of large text collections, and suggests how quantitative methods could be deployed in~translingual corpus-level literary research. It also argues for the use of stylometry at early stages of literary historical research to discover new paths of inquiry.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the northern catchment of Erhai Lake that lies in the heart of the ancient Southern Silk Road (the Tea-Horse Roads) in southwest China. The hydrologic environment of this region is complex and evolved under significant human impacts, especially after large populations migrated after 1382 under the policy of military tillage. This led to increased pressures on the human-water relationship of this region but also stimulated social resilience to water stresses. This paper investigates the manner in which local people addressed the conflicts of utilizing limited water for people, livestock and irrigation until 1912. The approaches of statistical analysis, spatial analysis and correlation analysis were adopted, and historical data on floods, water conservation projects, plants, and disease were collected to support a detailed examination of the evolution of the human-water relationship in the study area. The results indicate that: (1) the evolution of the hydrologic environment, including the river system and the hydro-chemical environment, had a close correspondence with human activities; (2) local people constructed various water conservation and engineering facilities and changed their farming structures to cope with water stresses, which partly contributed to the break out and spread of Schistosomiasis japonica; (3) the resilience of the human-water relationship became weaker as the management of water projects diminished; (4) the sustainable development of the human-water relationship could be maintained through regular water management and environmental governance. These findings emphasize the influences of social policy and human activities on the resilience of the catchment and improve our understanding of resilience theory.},

Analyses of the changes of the socio-environment system in this area enhance our understanding on the regular patterns of coupled natural and social evolution, and is thus of important theoretical and practical significance. We argue that the cross-cutting theme has been to reach beyond simple explanations of environmental or human determinism, but social resilience under environmental impacts. Studies indicate both that climate conditions significantly influence human socio-cultural systems and that the socio-culture systems are certainly resilient to climate impacts. This chapter also summarizes the scope of all chapters in this book by illustrating the specific topics, research areas, focused periods and their inner relationships. The conclusion further summarizes the recent research states on past socio-environmental dynamics and the findings achieved in this book, as well as some outlooks.},

By studying the city of Mersin and the surrounding area, it offers insights into the changing nature of Eastern Mediterranean port cities. The first part of the book discusses the approaches to the Mediterranean World, from the late prehistory to the present, and questions the implications of the values inherited from the past for a sustainable future. The second part then examines the social structure of Eastern Mediterranean port cities presenting an in-depth study of different ethnic groups and communities. In the third part the changing physical structure of these cities is elucidated from the perspectives of archaeology, architecture, and urban planning. The last part focuses on urban memory through a detailed study based on live recordings of original accounts by the local people. The book benefits prospective researchers in the field of Mediterranean studies, archaeology, history, economic history, architecture and urban planning.},

Female legislators’ speeches demonstrated characteristics of both a feminine language style (e.g. more use of emotion words, fewer articles) and a masculine one (e.g. more nouns and long words, fewer personal pronouns). A trend analysis found that these gender differences have consistently existed in the Congressional speeches over the past 20 years, regardless of the topic of debate. The findings lend support to the argument that gender differences in language use persist in professional settings like the floor of Congress.},

Biographies of the Prophet Muhammad, his Companions and other scholars have all been written with the intention of increasing Islamic faithfulness and piety. While illuminating or phenomenological studies of a few features of Islamic biographical writing exist, there is a need for a more analytical survey to show how biographical appearances evolved and developed. This article undertakes an exploratory analysis of ḥadīṯ scholars’ biographical dictionaries around the second/eight and third/ninth centuries as presented in their works. Apart from the scholarly trend and prevalent religious notions of the time, it will highlight this generation’s contribution and role to the field of Islamic scholarship as well as the influence upon the next generation. The many sub-genres of biographical dictionaries of ḥadīṯ transmitters that are presented in this article were composed over the first three Centuries of Islam and are celebrated as a result of this advancement in Islamic literature.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This chapter examines some of the discourses and practices through which, and the contexts in which, the scholarly tradition was cultivated in what ulama like Ali al-Qari clearly recognised as a cumulative endeavour. It explores how the religious authority was asserted through these discourses and practices. All six of the collections of hadith that carry the greatest authority in Sunni Islam were compiled by third-fourth/ninth-tenth-century scholars from north-east Iran and Central Asia. Compendia of legal doctrines, agreements and disagreements as well as commentaries on such works were central to the articulation, preservation and transmission of the ulama's discursive tradition. Certain texts gradually came to be invested with compelling authority within particular madhhabs. Medieval cosmopolitanism had its constraints, but scholarly learning remained, by far, its most important basis.},

  abstract = {This paper examines enigmatic, small, Arabic-inscribed copper coins that were minted or circulated in the environs of a Hindu cave temple complex in northern Gandhara. Based on legends and typology, most of these issues can be attributed to the Ghaznavid period. This new numismatic evidence calls into question long-standing narratives of the Ghaznavid invasion of Hindustan, which posit that the Ghaznavids pursued a uniformly iconoclastic policy toward Hindu sacred sites. The evidence also suggests that the Ghaznavids embraced diverse modes of interaction with the Hindustani frontier zones. These went beyond the well documented raiding expeditions to realize short-term financial gains. Rather, the Ghaznavids may also have had long-term economic objectives, which necessitated preserving existing sacred institutions and their administrative and fiscal machinery and patronage networks.},

Ziman discusses both questions in a very thoughtful  way. But still, differences between epistemological aims and methods in  those sciences and in the humanities must lead to quite different  conceptions of reliability and authority. And whatever we say about the  latter, for digital humanities those aims and methods must, I'd think,  fall somewhere between the two. What does reliability look like when you  use computational techniques to investigate cultural materials? How is  reliability achieved? To what degree is it valued? Certain questions in the human sciences can be resolved in a way that renders the matters they address stable for a long time, but these are relatively rare -- or seem so because once settled the achieving of an answer is forgotten, and if recalled, not valued very much after the lip-service has been paid. But surely there cannot be life in a discipline without constraints, without stability, without reliability against which to push. Comments?

Les armées musulmanes souffrirent longtemps d’un déficit de commandement et ne devinrent cohésives, disciplinées et correctement équipées qu’à partir de Zankī. La guerre, très présente, s’était alors déjà réglée, au moins en partie. Les coups de main rapides et la guerre de siège constituaient la majorité des affrontements. Les Francs comblèrent leur retard en matière de poliorcétique. Sur les champs de bataille, servis par un équipement lourd de qualité, leurs cavaliers perfectionnèrent leur charge massive et leur technique de la charge lance couchée; les cavaliers turcs, polyvalents, y répondirent par une discipline et une mobilité plus grandes encore.},

Our claim is that the humanities need an urgent answer to these questions given the increasing softwarization of both society and scholarship that pushes the boundaries of the methods and objects of study of the humanities. We argue that, as a result, there is a need to develop code criticism as a critical and reflexive tool within the humanities. Code criticism is described and positioned with respect to critical code studies, textual criticism, literary criticism, tool, and interface critique. Finally we outline an approach to code criticism based on ideas of reciprocal inquiry and of a continuum of literacies that connects code, code criticism, textual criticism, and literature.},

  abstract = {In this article we aim to provide a minimally sufficient theoretical framework to argue that it is time for a re-conception of the notion of text in the field of digital textual scholarship. This should allow us to reconsider the ontological status of digital text, and that will ground future work discussing the specific analytical affordances offered by digital texts understood as digital texts. Following from the argument of Suzanne Briet regarding documentation, referring to Eco’s understanding of ‘infinite semiosis’, and accounting for the reciprocal effects between carrier technology and meaning observed by McLuhan, we argue that the functions of document and text are realized primarily by their fluid nature and by the dynamic character of their interpretation. To define the purpose of textual scholarship as a ‘stabilisation’ of text is therefore fallacious. The delusive focus on ‘stability’ and discrete ‘philological fact’ gives rise to a widespread belief in textual scholarship that digital texts can be treated simply as representations of print or manuscript texts. On the contrary—digital texts are texts in and of themselves in numerous digital models and data structures which may include, but is not limited to, text meant for graphical display on a screen. We conclude with the observation that philological treatment of these texts demands an adequate digital and/or computational literacy.},
