<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> KWIC: Keywords-in-Context</h1>
<p>Keywords-in-context is the most common method for creating concordances — a view that that allows us to go through all instances of specific words or word forms in order to understand <em>how</em> they are used. The <code>quanteda</code> library offers a very quick and easy application of this method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb51-1"><a href="kwic-keywords-in-context.html#cb51-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(quanteda)</span>
<span id="cb51-2"><a href="kwic-keywords-in-context.html#cb51-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(readtext)</span>
<span id="cb51-3"><a href="kwic-keywords-in-context.html#cb51-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb51-4"><a href="kwic-keywords-in-context.html#cb51-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dispatch1862 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">readtext</span>(<span class="fu">paste0</span>(pathToFiles, <span class="st">&quot;dispatch_1862.tsv&quot;</span>), <span class="at">text_field =</span> <span class="st">&quot;text&quot;</span>, <span class="at">quote=</span><span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb51-5"><a href="kwic-keywords-in-context.html#cb51-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dispatch1862corpus <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">corpus</span>(dispatch1862)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, we can query the created <code>corpus</code> object using this command: <code>kwic(YourCorpusObject, pattern = YourSearchPattern)</code>. <code>pattern=</code> can also take vectors (for example, <code>c("soldier*", "troop*")</code>); you can also search for phrases with <code>pattern=phrase("fort donelson")</code>; <code>window=</code> defines how many words will be shown before and after the match.</p>
