The focus of the course is text analysis. The course will have three main parts: first, you will be introduced to the basics of R; second, you will learn about main text analysis methods; third, you will work on your own text analysis project. The language of the course is English. Personal computers are required both for in-class work and for your homework (running full versions of either Windows, MacOS, or Linux; unfortunately, neither tablets nor Chrome-based laptops are suitable for this course). No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. 0.2 Course Evaluation Course evaluation will be a combination of: in-class participation (30%), weekly homework workbooks (25%), DataCamp courses (25%), and the final project (20%). Final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups. 0.2.1 DataCamp This class is supported by DataCamp, the most intuitive learning platform for data science and analytics. Learn any time, anywhere and become an expert in R, Python, SQL, and more. DataCamp’s learn-by-doing methodology combines short expert videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises to help learners retain knowledge. DataCamp offers 350+ courses by expert instructors on topics such as importing data, data visualization, and machine learning. They’re constantly expanding their curriculum to keep up with the latest technology trends and to provide the best learning experience for all skill levels. Join over 6 million learners around the world and close your skills gap. You should all get access to DataCamp for the durations of the semester. If you cannot access it, please, contact me as soon as possible. DataCamp 0.3 Class Participation Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. BRING YOUR LAPTOP! We will accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, Linux), but it should be a laptop rather than a tablet. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation! 0.4 Homework Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what. NB: On submitting homework, see below. 0.5 Final Project Final project will be discussed later. You will have an option to build on what we will be doing in class, but you are most encouraged to pick a topic of your own. The best option will be to work on something relevant to your field of study, your term paper or your thesis. 0.6 Practice Worksheets (R Notebooks) 01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.zip 02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.zip 03_worksheets_data-manipulation-introduction.Rmd.zip 04_worksheets_data-manipulation-continued.Rmd.zip 05_worksheets_ggplot2-introduction-MGR-mod.Rmd.zip 06_worksheets_functions.Rmd.zip NB: Worksheets 1-6 have been developed by Lincoln Mullen.

Make sure to have them installed by the class when we are supposed to use them. The main tools for the course will be the programming language R and RStudio, the premier integrated development environment for R. R: https://cloud.r-project.org/ (choose the version for your operating system!) RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (RStudio Desktop, Open Source License — the free version) We will also use a variety of packages for R, which we will be installing when necessary. 0.9 Submitting Homework: 0.9.1 Handouts / Workbooks Homework assignments are to be submitted by the beginning of the next class; For the first few classes you must email them to the instructor (as attachments) Later, you will be publishing your homework assignments on your github pages and sending an email to the instructor informing that you have completed your homework and providing a relevant github link. In the subject of your email, please, use the following format: CourseID-LessonID-HW-Lastname-matriculationNumber, for example, if I were to submit homework for the first lesson, my subject header would look like: 070112-L01-HW-Romanov-12435687. DH is a collaborative field, so you are most welcome to work on your homework assignments in groups, however, you must still submit it. That is, if a groups of three works on one assignment, there must be three separate submissions: either emailed from each member’s email and published at each member’s github page. 0.9.2 DataCamp Assignments you are also assigned six four-hour interactive courses on different aspects of R on the educational platform DataCamp (&lt;www.datacamp.com&gt;); i.e., approximately one 4-hour course every two weeks. there are deadlines for each course, which are arranged in terms of your general progress (from introductory to intermediate). while you are enrolled in this course, you can also use any other courses on the DataCamp platform free of charge. I strongly recommend you to take advantage of this opportunity. 0.10 Schedule Location: Online 01 — Fri, 08. Apr. 2022 — 12:00—14:00 XX — Fri, 15. Apr. 2022 — Good Friday 02 — Fri, 22.

The original worksheets have been developed by Lincoln Mullen (https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/worksheets.html). The ones used in this class might have undergone some changes and relevant adaptations. Your R installation may ‘speak’ your main language. It is nice on one hand, but can be quite inconvenient in class, where the main language is English. You may have to do cast some spells to switch R into English. Possible solutions can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575180/how-to-change-language-settings-in-r/ 1.7 Homework Complete the worksheet Getting familiar with R. Generate the results into HTML or PDF (PDF is a little bit trickier). Start working through the first assigned course in DataCamp (two weeks to complete; requires about 4 hours) Submit your homework as described below. 1.8 Common issues with homework 1.8.1 Tracing errors Errors happen all the time. You will run into errors when you run your code. You will run into error messages when “knitting” your document — as a result, your document will not be generated. To resolve this: It is important to run each chunk of code separately to ensure that they all work. If any of the chunks throw errors, you will not be able to “knit” your documents. When you run into an error, R Markdown panel (usually in the lower left corner of RStudio interface) will tell you in which line the error occurred. You will need to fix it the same way you would in Step 1. 1.8.2 Comments / Commenting out You do not want to constantly keep [re]installing libraries. So, if a library is already installed, you can “comment out” that line. install.packages(&quot;historydata&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) For example, the code chunk above should become: #install.packages(&quot;historydata&quot;) #install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Adding # in front of a line (or a section of a line) turns it into a comment and it will not longer be executed. 1.8.3 Random errors: Think about the following two lines of code.

Creating one’s own dataset Digitizing data from printed and/or hand-written sources 5.3.2 Main format Relational databases or Tables/Spreadsheets (tabular data)? Tabular format: tables; spreadsheets; CSV/TSV files. Unique identifiers: tables with different data can be connected via unique identifiers Note: A relational database (rDB) is a collection of interconnected tables. Tables in an rDB are connected with each other via unique identifiers which are usually automatically created by the database itself when new data is added. One can maintain interconnected tables without creating a rDB: Open Linked Data Example: Table of the growth of cities. One table includes information on population over time; Another table includes coordinates of the cities from the dataset. It is more efficient and practical (reducing error rate from typos) to work on these tables separately, and connect them via unique identifiers of cities which are used in both tables. 5.3.2.1 Note on the CSV/TSV format CSV stands for comma-separated values; TSV — for tab-separated values. Below is an examples of a CSV format. Here, the first line is the header, which provides the names of columns; each line is a row, while columns are separated with , commas. city,growth_from_2000_to_2013,latitude,longitude,population,rank,state New York,4.8%,40.7127837,-74.0059413,8405837,1,New York Los Angeles,4.8%,34.0522342,-118.2436849,3884307,2,California Chicago,-6.1%,41.8781136,-87.6297982,2718782,3,Illinois Houston,11.0%,29.7604267,-95.3698028,2195914,4,Texas Philadelphia,2.6%,39.9525839,-75.1652215,1553165,5,Pennsylvania TSV is a better option than a CSV, since TAB characters (\\t) are very unlikely to appear in values. Neither TSV not CSV are good for preserving new line characters (\\n)—or, in other words, text split into multiple lines/paragraphs. As a workaround, one can convert \\n into some unlikely-to-occur character combination (for example, ;;;), which would be easy to restore into \\n later, if necessary. 5.3.3 Basic principles of organizing data: Tidy Data 5.3.3.1 Tidy Data Each variable is in its own column Each observation is in its own row Each value is in its own cell 5.3.3.2 Clean Data Column names and row names are easy to use and informative. In general, it is a good practice to avoid spaces and special characters. Good example: western_cities Alternative good example: WesternCities Bad example: Western Cities (only the largest) Obvious mistakes in the data have been removed Date format: YYYY-MM-DD is the most reliable format. Any thoughts why? There should be no empty cells: If you have them, it might be that your data is not organized properly. If your data is organized properly, NA must be used as an explicit indication that data point is not available. Each cell must contain only one piece of data. Variable values must be internally consistent Be consistent in coding your values: M and man are different values computationally, but may be the same in the dataset; Keep track of your categories: a document where all codes used in the data set are explained. Preserve original values If you are working with a historical dataset, it might be inconsistent. For example, distances between cities are given in different formats: days of travel, miles, farsaḫs/parasangs, etc.). Instead of replacing original values, it is better to create an additional column, where this information will be homogenized according to some principle. Keeping original data will allow to honogenize data in multiple ways (example: day of travel). Clearly differentiate between the original and modified/modelled values. The use of suffixes can be convenient: Distance_Orig vs Distance_Modified. Most of editing operations should be performed in software other than R; any spreadsheet program will work, unless it cannot export into CSV/TSV format. Keep in mind that if you prepare your data in an Excel-like program, rich formatting (like manual highlights, bolds, and italics) is not data and it will be lost, when you export your data into CSV/TSV format. Note: It might be useful, however, to use rule-based highlighting in order, for example, to identify bad values that need to be fixed. Back up your data! http://github.com is a great place for this, plus it allows to work collaboratively. Google spreadsheets is a decent alternative, but it lacks version control and detailed tracking of changes. 5.4 In Class II: Practical 5.4.1 Morris Dataset: the East Vs. the West War-making capacity since 4000 BCE (in social development points).

Fix the dataset so that it conforms to the principles of tidy data. What should be corrected? Load the data set into R Graph chronological changes in war-making capacities for the East and the West. When the East was in the lead? When the West was in the lead? How can you determine that? (Hint: review logical operators and vector comparison). 5.4.1.2 Difficulty: More complicated Digitize “Maximum Settlement Sizes” from this file Morris_2013_Combined.pdf. Fix the dataset so that it conforms to the principles of tidy data. What should be corrected? The datasets for the East and the West are separate. What would be your strategies to combine them? Graph chronological changes in war-making capacities for the East and the West. When the East was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements? When the West was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements? How can you determine that? (Hint: review logical operators and vector comparison). 5.5 OCR in R As was noted above, we can use R to OCR text in PDFs and images. The following libraries will be necessary. library(pdftools) library(tidyverse) library(tesseract) library(readr) This code we can use to OCR individual PNG files. text &lt;- tesseract::ocr(pathToPNGfile, engine = tesseract(&quot;eng&quot;)) readr::write_lines(text, str_replace(pathToPNGfile, &quot;.png&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;)) This code can be used to process entire PDFs: imagesToProcess &lt;- pdftools::pdf_convert(pathToPDFfile, dpi = 600) text &lt;- tesseract::ocr(imagesToProcess, engine = tesseract(&quot;eng&quot;)) readr::write_lines(text, str_replace(pathToPDFfile, &quot;.pdf&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;)) NB: I had issues running pdftools on Mac.

One of the most common way of modeling data in historical research—joining items into broader categories. Categorization is important because it allows to group items with low frequencies into items with higher frequencies, and through those discern patterns and trends. Additionally, alternative categorizations allow one to test different perspectives on historical data. The overall process is rather simple in terms of technological implementation, but is quite complex in terms of subject knowledge and specialized expertise which is required to make well-informed decisions. For example, let’s say we have the following categories: baker, blacksmith, coppersmith, confectioner, and goldsmith. These can be categorized as occupations; Additionally, blacksmith, coppersmith, and goldsmith can also be categorized as ‘metal industry’, while baker and confectioner, can be categorized as ‘food industry’; Yet even more, one might want to introduce additional categories, such as luxury production to include items like goldsmith and confectioner; and regular production for items like baker, blacksmith, coppersmith. Such categorizations can be created in two different ways, with each having its advantages: first, one can create them as additional columns. This approach will allow to always have the original—or alternative—classifications at hand, which is helpful for re-thinking classifications and creating alternative ones where items will be reclassified differently, based on a different set of assumptions about your subject. second, these can be created in separate files, which might be easier as one does not have to stare at existing classifications and therefore will be less influenced by them in making classification decisions. Additionally, one can use some pre-existing classifications that have already been created in academic literature. These most likely need to be digitized and converted into properly formatted data, as we discussed in the previous lesson. 6.3.2 Normalization This is a rather simple, yet important procedure, which is, on the technical side, very similar to what was described above. In essence, the main goal of normalization is to remove insignificant differences that may hinder analysis. Most common examples would be: bringing information to the same format (e.g., dates, names, etc.) unifying spelling differences It is a safe practice to preserve the initial data, creating normalized data in separate columns (or tables) 6.3.3 Note: Proxies, Features, Abstractions These are the terms that refer to the same idea. The notion of proxies is used in data visualization, that of features—in computer science; that of abstractions—in the humanities (see, for example, Franco Moretti’s Graph, Maps, Trees). The main idea behind these terms is that some simple features of an object can act as proxies to some complex phenomena. For example, Ian Morris uses the size of cities as a proxy to the complexity of social organization. The logic is following: the larger the size of a city, the more complex social, economic and technical organization is required to keep that city functional, therefore it alone can be used as an indicator of the social complexity (or a proxy to the social complexity). While proxies are selected from what is available—usually not much, especially when it comes to historical data—as a way to approach something more complex, it may be argued that abstractions are often arrived to from the opposite direction. We start with an object which is available in its complexity and we reduce its complexity to a more manageable form which—we expect—would prepresent a particular aspect of the initial complex object. Most commonly this is applied to texts in a natural language. For example, in stylometry texts are reduced to freqiency lists of most frequent features, which are expected to represent an authorial fingerprint. The complexity of texts can be reduced in a number of ways: into a list of lemmas (e.g., for topic modeling analysis), frequency lists (e.g., for document distance comparison, such as, for example, stylometry), keyword values (e.g., for identifying texts on a similar topic, using, for example, the TF-IDF method), syntactic structures, ngrams, etc. As you get to practice and experiment more, you will start coming up withyour own ways of creating abstractions depending on your current research questions. 6.4 In Class II: Practical Data for the practical session and homework: Bosker_Data.zip. The data is available in open access and is a supplement to a study (see, Reference Materials). The zipped file includes everything you need for the practical session. Download and unzip (read the article at home!). Note: create a notebook and work through the following questions. Group work is encouraged. Please, explain in one or two sentences what you do in each step, so that your work is also human readable. Please, submit this notebook as your homework. Make sure to name your file in the following manner: 57528-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber.EXT, where LXX is the number of the lesson for which you submit homework; YourLastName is your last name; and YourMatriculationNumber is your matriculation number; EXT is the extension of your file — yopu can submit it either as HTML or as a PDF. 6.4.1 SECTION I. Please, provide your answers (2-3 sentences) to the following questions: Can you figure which file contains data? In which format is data? How can we load it into R? (Describe and provide working R code) What is the chronological extent of this data? [easy-ish] What periods can it be divided into? How can we do that? How can we introduce the following categories into this data: [easy] North Africa and Europe? [a bit more complicated] the Ottoman Empire? [a tad tricky] Christiandom and Islamdom? 6.4.2 SECTION II Please, provide your answers as working R code and a couple of sentences to describe how you approach (2-3 sentences) the following problems: What is the chronological extent of this data? [easy-ish] What periods can it be divided into? How can we do that? Can you generate a cumulative graph of population over time, divided into these periods? (Hint: there should be one line for one period and another for another, etc.) How can we introduce the following categories into this data: [easy] North Africa and Europe? Construct comparative graphs of population in North Africa and Europe (similar to what you did with the Morris dataset). Here you will need to sum up population! [a bit more complicated] the Ottoman Empire? When did the Empire had the largest number of cities (based on the data set)? When was its population at the highest? [a tad tricky] Christiandom and Islamdom? What are the largest cities of Islamdom for each reported period? What are the largest western cities of Islamdom between 1000 and 1500 CE? 6.5 Reference Materials Bosker, Maarten, Eltjo Buringh, and Jan Luiten van Zanden. 2012. “From Baghdad to London: Unraveling Urban Development in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, 800–1800.” The Review of Economics and Statistics 95 (4): 1418–37. https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00284.
