## Homework{#HW04}

- Finish your worksheet and submit your HW as described below.
* *Additional:* if you'd like more practice, you can use `swirl` library:
  * To install: `install.packages("swirl")`
  * To run: `library(swirl)`
    * Then: `swirl()`
    * it will offer you a set of interactive exercises similar to DataCamp.

## Submitting homework{#SHW04}

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Email your homework to the instructor as attachments.
	*  In the subject of your email, please, add the following: `57528-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber`, where `LXX` is the number of the lesson for which you submit homework; `YourLastName` is your last name; and `YourMatriculationNumber` is your matriculation number.
